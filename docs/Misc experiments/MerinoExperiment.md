# Can I only pack 2 shirts?

I really hate packing clothes for travel. It's bulky and inconvenient.

I don't really care if people think I'm not fashionable; I prefer people to think I'm unfashionable than having to deal with the mess that's overpacking.

Didn't think there was any solution to this since packing only 2 shirts for vacation usually means disgusting smells and bacteria.

But I recently came upon some YouTube videos touting praises for merino wool, where you basically can wear it indefinitely as it's antimicrobial. And it won't smell.

This post investigates merino wool, and minimalist packing for vacation in general.

## Merino Wool

A big brand influencers push is Unbound Merino, and they're very expensive. I don't want to commit that much yet, unless I know merino is actually antimicrobial and you can actually wear it forever.

A brand nobody talks about but is one of my favorite brands is: Uniqlo.

In [Japan](../../travel journal/asia 2023/japan), I bought 3 merino long sleeves for less than $20 each.

The test is simple. As of writing, I'm currently [cutting](../../body experiments/DietProtocol2024) and need to do cardio anyway. So I'm going to **subject it to my nasty cardio sweat:**

**Every. Single. Day. For a month.**

This is a good stress test since I generally won't be sweating if I am deciding it's cold enough to wear a long sleeve.

If after a month, it has no smell, then I'm good to buy some short-sleeve shirts from Unbound Merino (otherwise it's too hot to wear when it's hot).
