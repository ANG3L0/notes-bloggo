# Cut H1 2024

I got fat during [this trip](../../travel journal/asia 2023/itinerary). How fat?

* Weight: 183 -> 196lb
* BMI: 27 -> 29.
* Body fat %: 21.5 -> 24.8
* Muscle %: 50.7 -> 48.6

App says my metabolic age is 38.

I've started snoring.

So, the plan is to cut a lot of weight and fat (while retaining as much muscle as I can). Intent is both for aesthetic and health. Here's a snapshot of where I'm at right now.

## Plan

The plan's to:

* Eat 1500 calories. Rule of thumb is if you want to lose weight at X pounds, you should at 10\*X calories. I'm too lazy to dynamically adjust calories so I'll just set it at 10\*(Goal weight).
* Do ~200g protein a day
* Workout + cardio

## The Food

200g of protein at 1500 calories is hard because you'd normally just resort to chicken breast. Luckily, Alex Hormozi released [some recipes](https://www.acquisition.com/hubfs/One%20of%20Zero/Hormozi%20full%20cookbook.pdf?utm_campaign=Mozination%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=288555990&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---baP2TbueDsTE8tk-XWaYca6eeKjqhLljPa-5ORNohbrlXpJiKVVeFOa20ZWqEFPi3pRI1kGAgbKQUWe769QxIbJorw&utm_content=288555990&utm_source=hs_automation) that are:

- Low prep time
- High in protein
- Low in calories

A few recipes I'll play with:

**Tuna protein bomb:**

![Tuna bomb](../images/tuna_bomb.jpg)

- 1.5 cup fat free yogurt (Fage)
- 2 cans of chicken of the sea.
- **96g protein.**
- **440 calories**
- The recipe says add mustard to taste, but I don't have mustard so will add sriracha instead. Will buy mustard later and play around with that.

**Chococlate Protein Cereal**

* 2 cups premier protein cereal
* 1/3rd of a premiere protein shake
* Almond milk to taste
* **50g protein**
* **413 calories**

Chose this because the cereal and the shakes are relatively cheap. Also, at 1/3rd a shake per meal I can stretch the $2.5 shakes for a while.

**Cauliflower ground beef**

* Cauliflower rice
* 1 lb ground beef (90/10)
* Sriracha to taste.
* **88g protein**
* **800 calories**

Instead of cauliflower, can feel free to substitute it with any leafy greens/0-calorie veggie (non-starch). Don't use additional oil when stir frying; use the oil from the beef, so toss in the beef a little earlier than you normally would to render out fat.

**Hot pot lamb**

Weee sells [these hot pot lamb packages](https://www.sayweee.com/en/product/Sliced-Lamb-Shoulder-Roll/101096) that's 600 calories + 92g protein.

* 1 lb lamb, boiled.
* Veggie.
* Sriracha, hot chili flakes to taste.

He also has kind of "bro" recipes which consist of 1L of egg whites which is too much for me. I also skipped more expensive options like beef jerky and expensive protein shakes.

As you can see, I can hit 200g protein pretty easily without hitting 1.5k calories. Especially since I have whey iso powder that'll let me do ~40 grams of protein at around 250 calories. Some examples:

![Example cut meals](../images/meals_example.jpg)

So I can do a yogurt + cereal + protein shake for 1100 calories, and then back fill the rest with ice cream or something. Who cares. I'm not going to cry about 14 missing calories especially if my target weight is much under 200lb (and thus don't need 200g strictly for 1g/lb of body weight). Example of how much ice cream I can eat if I need to backfill 400 calories once I hit my protein requirements:

![Look mom, I'm on a diet!](../images/icecream_diet.jpg)

> Look mom, I'm on a diet!

Or I can do a half portion of yogurt + Cereal + beef + 1 scoop of protein shake and hit my macros / calories.

Or I can do a beef + yogurt + 1 scoop protein shake to hit my protein, and eat some snacks for an extra 150 calories.

Or I can just do a half portion cereal, plus beef, plus 2 protein shakes (4 scoops) and it'll also be kind of perfect.

Notes:

* For the yogurt recipe I prefer to split it into 2 sittings, spread 2 hours apart, so I can digest it better (average about 50g protein per meal).
* Beef can be split into 2 meals this way as well. But depends on time. Reheating it in the microwave takes time, whereas taking a prepped tuna+yogurt doesn't.

## Exercise

I plan to just do simple Zone 2 cardio for about 20-45 mins a day (starting at 20 and then progressing to 45 over 6 months). This is just jogging outside or if weather doesn't permit or if I'm lazy, just do inclined treadmill speedwalking.

For lifting, I plan to just do my regular lifting routine 5 days a week, except since I haven't worked out consistently in 2 months, I'll reduce my weights by about 20% and then start from there. If I have to go do more reps to failure, so be it. Then increase weights as my body feels "warmed up" across a bunch more sessions.

Exercise for strictly losing weight isn't that important--it's mostly diet. But since I want to lose as little muscle mass as I can, I'm maximizing protein (see above), and then also trying to get some intense lifts in.

## Hurdles

This is January 2024 as I'm writing this but I'll go to:

* Thailand for about 1.5 weeks in Feburary
* California for a couple weeks in March

These will present hurdles and halt any weight loss. On vacation, I'll try to exercise but I probably won't adhere to any sort of diet since I want it to be fun.

Thus, my prediction is that I'll make some decent progress come February and then revert some of it in Thailand, and then resume good progress again until March, where it'll be reversed a bit again, and then I'll continue to cut until June-ish, or until I hit one of the following goals, or stop conditions:

* I stop snoring, and then minus 10-20 lbs after that
* 150 lbs.
* I feel significantly weaker (my lifts have declined 25% from max).

I want to be very skinny to build a good base so I can bulk to around 180-200lb again where my muscle % would be much higher and my fat % much lower.

## Cheat Days

I will do this without cheat days mostly because of the hurdles above. I'll already have large refeeding periods in February and March, so I don't feel like cheat days are necessary.

I may add cheat days after March's trip though.

## Results

To keep myself accountable, below's a log of my results. Keep in mind body fat is not going to be accurate since nothing really measures bf accurately. I'm mostly looking forward to have it go down in a trend. Weight by itself is also a poor measure of a diet.

But weight + bf is easy enough to understand so I'll use those stats. To supplement my understanding of how the cut's going, I'll look at my physique, energy levels, strength, and make adjustments from there.

Daily reports are kind of a waste of time. Some say you should take the average (or median is probably better) of your daily measurements across a week. I'll just update the below once or twice a week, and then post-process after.

## Log

"Raw" means I just woke up, peed, and naked. Otherwise you may consider it as uncalibrated / more or less a rough estimation of state.

* Jan 9: 196lb, 24.8% bf.
* Jan 12: 191.2lb, 23.7% bf, raw.
