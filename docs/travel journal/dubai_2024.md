# Dubai + Abu Dhabi 2024

## Overview

I went to meet up with Serena in Dubai on April 15, and traveled to Abu Dhabi as well in a 1.5 week trip.

## Departure

SFO -> DXB.

Emirates business class. I didn't know that even with business class, there is free limo service to SFO if you're within 50 miles. Had my neighbor drive me to airport instead -- dumb. Next time!

### The Airport Lounge

Emirates SFO lounge is good. Crowded but tables aren't too close so it doesn't feel cramped. You can board from the lounge normally, but we were delayed by 2h and had to change gates so had to go outside the lounge to board the plane. The food's OK.

### The Seat

The seat's great. 1-2-1 configuration on an A380. I got the window seat. I like these because the lay-flats actually have room for your legs. In SQ business class, your legs are crammed into a small cubby hole, making sleeping a little difficult. Sleeping's very easy on an Emirates business class flight. Of course, I tried my best not to sleep.

The ICE entertainment system was great; tons of movies. I watched a lot of trashy American action films on the plane. My seat had 2 windows, whose shades are electronically controlled. There's also various plane cameras you can look on the TV--this made the takeoff and landing very immersive. The flight's 16 hours, going north, through the North Pole, and then down South. Witnessed 2 sunsets. As you can see below, the first sunset was on the left (since I'm flying north and sun sets in the west), and the 2nd sunset's on the right (since I'm flying south). Take that, flat-earthers!

When they dim the cabin lights, there are little LEDs resembling stars on the roof, like a Rolls-Royce.

### Amenities

The PJs are really great. Nice, airy, and stretchy. And a bunch of other items, like lip balm and shaving kit, etc. in the amenities kit. The bag's more impressive though, and from Bulgari.

### Airplane Lounge

This is the best part of Emirates business class. There's a bar area where you can keep drinking. And even better, there are large seating areas with windows that makes it feel like a private jet.

There's crowds of people in the first 2-3 hours of the flight. But the rest of the 16 hours, it's fairly private back there.

It's also where people line up to go to the bathroom. This is a good thing because unlike most planes, it's a pretty wide area so you're not cramped while waiting in line to pee on a plane.

The bad thing is there's almost always people waiting to go to the bathroom because everyone in business class can have unlimited free drinks.

## The Great Dubai Flood

Met up with Serena in Terminal 1 of DXB which is a clusterfuck compared to T3 (which is where Emirates Airline's based). After a long wait to get an Uber, it started raining. Didn't think much of it.

Woke up next day and things were flooded. Luckily we arrived when we did, otherwise we might've been stuck at the airport for 19+ hours.

Not much to say here other than my 1st time in Dubai and my impression is that it's a 3rd world country. The hotel's **leaking water everywhere** -- the fancy Italian restaurant had leaks above the window, so the water was flowing down it, like a water feature. 3/4 elevators were closed, and the one that was open was dripping water from the shaft.

Most rainfall in 75+ years, yes. But it's still only 142mm of rain in a day. Many cities get 100mm+ in a day and don't flood like this. And buildings / malls don't leak water like this. Just shoddy construction, period.

They drained water with trucks that would suck up water and then dump the water in a local sewer.

And because of the flood, there are not many taxis available and many roads were flooded. As a result, price gouging for taxis occurred. Serena had to go to a conference and reported that a 10 minute ride was $50 USD (good thing it can be expensed).

Plus, there was a conference so there's many people in town + lack of ability to get from point A to point B = bad impressions for Dubai.

Anyway, due to the insane taxi fares I didn't get to explore Dubai much but my impressions of it, like I said, is that it's 3rd world. Except 3rd world infrastructure can handle a normal amount of rainfall like 142mm. So it's probably more accurate to say that Dubai's worst than 3rd world, despite all the marketing. Left for Abu Dhabi on April 20th AKA BTC halving day (4 days later) and some parts of the highway were still flooded.

Dubai Bling lied to me.

## Abu Dhabi

We went to Abu Dhabi to check out some 5 star hotels there.

### St. Regis (Apr 20)

They upgraded us to a suite. It's pretty amazing. A full living room, bedroom, grand bathroom, as well as a walk-in closet with stitched-leather walls. A corner unit, we got views of the gulf + neighboring islands from both the bedroom and the living room.

Other differentiators:

* There's a 24/7 butler service included
* Champagne Sabering, where they chop open a champagne bottle and give you free booze (2+ drinks per person)
* Regular welcome drink (nonalcoholic)
* 2 drinks in either of their bars, complimentary.
* 50% off drinks, happy hour (about $10 for a cocktail)
* Birthday cake with balloons for Serena in-room.
* During the Sabering, they also surprised us with another cake.
* Private beach.
* Common area has Arabic coffee that someone pours for you, and sweets.
* Excellent service all around.

Since we had $100 Amex dining credit, we used it at an Italian restaurant. We were originally concerned about not being full, but after the 2 cakes and the below food, I was actually unbelievably stuffed.

Next day we went to the 3rd biggest mosque in the world / largest in UAE. Not as good as the one we went to in Casablanca, because they roped off most of the sections.

But it's free, so.

### Conrad (April 21)

As I write this whole post, I am in Conrad. Also very nice in its own way. St. Regis suite is very luxurious, smells amazing, and has its own personality. Conrad's room is more streamlined, but still very 5-stars and grand. Conrad's gym is also nicer.

Great view (it's only 5 mins away from St. Regis), and they surprised us with birthday cake + wine which I am holding in the picture below.
