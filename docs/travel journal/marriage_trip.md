# 2025 The Marriage Trip

## Overview

This is a 4 week trip. Primary purpose is to get married / have a travel destination wedding in Italy.

April 13 to May 12 2025, inclusive.

## Part 1: Florence

### April 13 - 14

We flew Emirates business class in JFK -> MXP.

Food in lounge is quite delicious and Emirates business class lounge is quite spacious. They had everything from checken legs to (small) lamb chops, to desserts of various kinds.

5-6 plates of small food later, we boarded our Emirates business class. This A380 is nice and I spent most of it not sleeping. The lounge was cool but unlike the A380 I flew SFO->DXB, there's no desk setup that makes it feel like a private jet.

The food on the plane was very good, from Chilean Sea Bass to Osso Bucco. Med meats are always kind of Mid Meats, because they are kind of dry. But overall, delicious. For booze, I just had an espresso martini and a Glenmorangie.

A movie and a nap later, we had breakfast. It as a lobster omelette with croissants, breads, and coffee. Good, 3.5/5, wished they had more lobster in the omelette though.

Getting through customs was fast. And by the time we got to luggage claim, all 3 of our luggages were there. I've never retrieved my luggage this quickly. After we speedrun the luggage claim, which took all of 10-20 seconds, we went to our restroom and met our private driver who drove us 4 hours from MXP to Firenze.

We met up with Serena's friends for dinner and ate a lot.

Better than I've eaten in a long time. And it's been a very long time since I've had good, authentic Italian food. From linguini pasta with an amazing sauce to well-balanced, heavy Italian dumplings, to mushroom pasta, to a mountain of Tiramisu, it was all really good.

What's even better is the service: they gave us a bunch of free food on the side, and on top of that they had this really amazing spicy sauce you can slobber all over your food.

On the way to the restaurant, we took the bus but on the way back, there were no more busses so we walked in the rain for about 30 minutes to get back to the hotel.

### April 15

Couldn't really sleep due to jetlag. Slept from maybe 5AM to 9:30AM.

Went out to meet Serena's friends to eat lunch at a place called Trattoria Sergio Gozzi. It was really good. We had:

* Beef stew - 2/5 too salty but sauce was good.
* Pork chop - 3/5 average.
* Pastas - 3/5 average. Not al dente enough.
* Liver - 6/5 so juicy, so moist. Just like fois gras.
* House wine - 4/5, more sour than full-bodied. Very nice to cut through the gamey liver and meats.
* Overall: 4/5, the liver + wine really slaps.

I ended up eating the most as usual. Even more than the pregnant woman at the table. Did everyone else eat anorexic amounts, or do I eat too much?

Walked around and took some photos outside the Duomo. We also did some afternoon espresso, which was followed by a quick Merry Go Around stop at the city center.

We walked around a little bit more and then did afternoon tea/coffee in the city center, next to the Merry Go Around. Half of Serena's friends went back home to sleep, another stayed with us to walk around a bit more, including a trip to [Cantina del Gelato, which we always visit in Florence](../italy_2023).

At around 7PM, we made our way to a restaurant inside Hotel Hermitage. Famous for truffles, maybe? Had:

* Pasta with regular truffle - 1/5, was like pasta boiled in water only. No taste.
* Pasta with winter truffle - 3/5, had some truffle flavor but still bland.
* Osso buco - 4/5 - Good flavor, falls apart nicely.
* Chicken breast with lemon sauce - 4/5 - I really liked the lemon sauce as it was nice and tart, which is nice to eat with meats. The chicken breast itself was moist which is hard to do.
* Chicken breast with truffle - 4/5 - Also moist chicken breast and the truffle adds a little bit to the sauce.
* Beef tartare - 5/5. It also had truffle that I can barely taste but beef tartare always tastes good.
* Slices of beef - 3.5/5. These are like thin slices of raw steak which is nice, and showered with truffle. But the truffle had zero taste compared to the beef tartare.
* Fettucine ragu - 4/5 - Ragu nicely flavored, nice contrast to bland AF truffle dishes.
* Overall - 3/5. Slow-ish service and quite expensive for what it was.

Then we went to Cantina del Gelato again. Their gelato is nice, creamy, and smooth unlike many other places that are maybe too dense, too sweet, or just lacks a je nais se quois.

Walked back home (no rain today, yay) for about 30 mins.

### April 16

Slept poorly. Woke at 2AM. Went to sleep at 5AM. Woke up again at 8:30AM. Went to go pick up our rental car near SMN.

We got a car upgrade because of Amex plat, and we landed a blue Renault Australe. It has a range of 1050km (about 680+ miles) which is ridiculous.

After that, we went to eat at Sabatino's, one of Anthony Bourdain's recommendations. They do simple, local, and affordable food. We had:

* Papardelle pasta 5/5 - al dente, creamy and savory.
* Pork liver - 5/5, not as juicy and tender's as yesterday's, but really nice dense flavors and pairs well with their wine and sides.
* Radish and leeks as sides - 5/5 - nice, fresh, and crunchy, it goes really well with the heavy food / pasta that we had. The leeks had a little bit of a spice to it, like eating raw onions, so this made all the food even better.
* Guinea Fowl - I thought this was rabbit due to ChatGPT translation, but it was just a very lean chicken. 3/5. A little dry but not bad overall.
* Boiled chicken with stuffed pistachios - 4/5, good.
* Wine - 5/5. More on the sour side like yesterday's house red, but the way it paired with the rest of the meal was really good. Moreover, it was only 1.5 euros which is the cheapest I've ever paid for wine I think.
* Americano 4/5 - OK.
* Desserts - 3.5/5 - we had a couple of pastries, not too sweet but not so great as to write home about.

Then, we walked to the Florence market and had lampredotto at a place called Da Nerbone. The place is popular due to it being in business since 1873. So we waited in line for 35 minutes before we got our pig stomach plate + panini. It was 5/5 good but including wait time 2/5 -- wouldn't wait just for this.

We walked around a bit more and did window shopping. Once we finished buying absolutely nothing, we went to get a gelato at a new, hip place. They had spicy Mayan chocolate which tastes like a smooth, creamy chocolate gelato at the start but the after taste comes with smoke! 5/5.

Went home and chilled; wanted to lift weights. They only had one of those all-in-one machines and while not ideal, it was also completely broken so I can't lift anything. We instead found a nice terrace to practice our first dance. But the whole terrace was so ridden with bed bugs that we only practiced twice.

Took a shower, chilled for a bit, went out to dinner at Trattoria Osteria Dall'oste. We had:

* T-bone steaks, 5/5 - good cook on it.
* Various parma hams - 4/5 - a bit too salty after eating too much.
* Truffle pasta - 4/5 - much more truffle than yesterday's "truffle" pasta.
* Steak tartare - 5/5. Good with a nicely salted egg yolk.
* Carpaccio - 3.5/5 - good but not that much meat flavors.
* Some rigatoni - 3/5 - good.
* Papardelle - 4/5 - good, nice and creamy.

Too full, went home after.

### April 17

Good sleep. Woke up at 6A then slept again until 11:30AM. About 11 hours of sleep.

Met up with Serena's friends and ate lunch.

Went home and chilled. Had a bit of a stomach ache. Had:

* Carbonara - 4/5 - was good and the guanciale was good. Maybe a little tough and not as fatty as the best guanciale.
* Beef tartare - 5/5 - sweet caramelized onions + cheese in the middle of the tartare really put it over the top.
* Overall: 4/5

Went back home and chilled. This is more of a recovery day as we are trying to save energy to do the whole wedding thing.

Went back out for dinner at a famous place called Il Lattini. It was trash. We had the family meal:

* Parma ham and meats which is OK, 3/5.
* Unknown sides were given to us, which were all very salty. 2/5.
* Steak: 1/5 - they insist on cooking it rare but their meat is too lean to cook rare. So it had the same effect as overcooked meat: way too tough and rubbery. My jaw had a harder workout going through this meat than an OF model going through their meat on a shoot. What a waste.
* Dessert: Tiramisu and other stuff, 4/5 but at this point we were all tired and sort of turned off by the food and service (which was very slow).

I had to ask 3 times before I could get fork + knife utensils to eat the steak with. Overall: 1/5. Not sure why the internet hyped it up. This place is the closest in making me hate food.

## Part 2: Getting Married / Villa Cini

### April 18: The Welcome Dinner

After mysteriously stabbing my finger on a luggage while checking out of our hotel in Florence, we drove to pick up Serena's pregnant friend.

Then, with much restraint, I drove to Villa Cini, the Villa we'll get married at.

Serena went to do her makeup and once everything's settled in, guests started arriving. After I welcomed them to their rooms, it was almost time for the welcome dinner.

We were deciding between indoor and outdoors as there's 20% chance of rain. But it was so nice outside that we risked it and it ended up not raining. And there was even 20 minutes of golden hour photos to be taken.

For the welcome dinner, we had:

* Endless pizza - 5/5, they had everything from pepperoni pizza to truffle pizza to everything else. As they have a very nice mobile pizza oven, everything was baked fresh and delicious.
* Endless gelato - 5/5. Hard to complain about gelato.
* Red wine - 5/5 - actually a bit more full bodied, sweeter, and easy to go down than house wine by a lot. Not bad. People asked us if we tasted the wine before and the question itself is giving us too much credit probably. But I'm glad the wine tastes good.

At the welcome dinner, 2 of Serena's friends revealed they were pregnant (we already knew though). And my friends arrived as well!

Later, I was talking about how I had to drive slow because there's a pregnant woman in my car (referring to Sally's friend). My neighbor mistook this to mean Serena was pregnant, which I'd find out later in a pool game.

After welcome dinner, Serena's family threw a huge and elaborate surprise for her. It consisted of:

* A competition where we have a bunch of people's faces, shredded in strips. And first one to put Serena's face together wins.
* A roundtable about what each family unit on Serena's side thinks she will be when she grows up.
* A roundable about what each family unit on Serena's side likes most about Serena.
* A binder of childhood photos gifted to Serena.
* A gift of a mirror and a jewelry box. The jewelry box is then filled with 3 notes per family unit so Serena can take a look over a long time to see the love her family has for her.

After that's done, they prepared fruits in our bedroom and I went down to play pool by myself a little bit. There were also fruit flies so I put the fruit in the fridge downstairs.

As I was playing a little bit of pool by myself, I heard some talking outside and flashlight outside. Turns out my cousin's family + my brother came over and wanted to play as well. So we played for a bit.

After playing for an hour and only hitting 3 balls in, we gave up and they went up and I went upstairs to sleep.

### April 19: Best Day Of My Life

I woke up at around 830AM and went downstairs to pay the baker who dropped off a bunch of croissants. Serena's friend's husband cooked me instant noodles. Toasted the croissants at 100C and ate those toasty croissants.

After breakfast, I went for a swim at the pool. It was somewhat of a mistake because while the weather is 50F and my thinking was that "it won't be that cold when I get out of the water," I neglected to think about just how fucking cold 50F water is, with its immense thermal conductivity. I dove in and almost went numb immediately. I thought that I could generate internal heat to offset the cold, but even after 5 minutes of intense swimming when my heart was sprinting, my skin feels like it was being burned by the cold. I showered after that and we did a photoshoot at 12:45PM with "the boys." They consisted of my cousin, brother, and friend. After the photoshoot, we played some pool until 1:30PM and then did a "first look" photoshoot at 2PM.

After the photoshoot, we got ready for the ceremony.

We did some beautiful ass vows. And we got married. We did a sand ceremony thing where we intertwined ourselves by pouring different colored sands into a bottle. The ceremony was perfect because it was close, intimate group of people. And the weather was perfect, and the flowers were nice and pastel and fresh and perfect. It was raining *all week* and this was the only day where it was nice and had a good amount of sun, without being too hot.

After the ceremony and photos, it was around 4PM and we did aperitifs. I had:

* Parma Ham: 5/5 - it is as good as any parma ham.
* Fried goods - 5/5 - it is fresh fried and hot.
* Quail egg on toast with truffles - 5/5 because you can read, right?
* Wines - 5/5 - same wine as yesterday.

Right after apertifs, we did an entrance at 6PM to do the reception dinner so that the risotto can come out perfeclty at 6:15PM. I did an improvised toast that was apparently touching because it made Serena cry. And then we had:

* Risotto - 5/5, actually done correctly and boldly al dente. I hate soggy risotto.
* Ravioli with stuffed pork - 5/5: moist, juicy, savory. The amount was only 2 large raviolis and the presentation was meh, but the taste was amazing.
* Florentine steak with sides. The great thing about the steak was that they keep going around with various cooks and you can get as many pieces as you want. The first round was well-done mandatory, so 4.5/5, but I was able to eat a round of "very rare" which is wayyyy better than Il Latini, as it was thinly sliced and smooth--but I was unable to enjoy more round as we were called into doing a Golden Hour photoshoot.
* Dessert was the wedding cake which was very nice and moist. Sweet, but not too sweet.

After dinner, at around 8:30PM, we went to practice our first dance in our room for 2 reps. Then, we went back out and Serena did her bouquet throwing, where Serena's sister Lorraine forced it into one of her friends after catching it. By this time, we did our first dance at 9:10PM after waiting for Serena's mom to change her dress, and we executed it PERFECTLY.

This is a miracle because I forget some parts a lot of times, but the warmups help my neural networks to execute the dance moves perfectly.

We literally danced and danced, until more and more people left, as they do.

But unlike most wedding dances where it lasts for maybe 30-90 mins, many stayed until 11:30PM/12AM. One of the main things that helped was the weather. It was more chilly so it enabled people to dance more as their generated heat offsets the cold. Whereas a summer wedding, you'd usually see folks almost pass out after 20 minutes of intense dancing. It was kind of interesting because as Serena's sister and cousin danced, you can see that they got progressively more drunk and would hug and mutter "I love you"s to you. It was strange but flattering. 

I got super drunk and bumped into one of Serena's friends and got red wine all over my suit. While the suit is expensive, it kind of doesn't matter because I realize my suit is never really going to be worn again (I work remote, and even if I don't, I'm in tech so the only time I wear suits is at people's wedding and I have other, higher quality, suits already).

Later on, one of Serena's friends picked the Gulu Gulu theme (Hong Kong cartoon from way long ago)--it is one of my favorite childhood cartoons so I danced the shit out of it.

I guess I'm a good dancer because I got compliments about how I'm the best dancer from:

* Our wedding planner's assistant
* My friends
* The DJ
* Most everyone else

More and more left until Serena's last high school friends wanted to leave. Then a blackpink song came on and I pulled one of Serena's high school friends to do one more dance with me. I asked:

> Are your friends waiting for you?

And showed me her car keys and said

> They can't leave without me

To which I laughed immensely and kept dancing.

At the end, the sole survivors were just Serena and I dancing like we're on ecstasy from 12AM to 12:40AM on the dance floor with the DJ blasting music. This ecstasy of dancing with my wife, with a private DJ, lights shining on us, is one of the highlights of my life.

Overall, I'm very happy and one of my friends told me it's the best wedding she ever went to. And it seems like everyone had a great time without any drama. The food was good and booze was abundant.

This is the best day of my life and I hope I don't forget a single moment of it. Though it'll be hard as I've had a lot to drink.

### April 20: Cooking Class

On this day, we had breakfast at the villa. A few chefs came and basically laid out a huge spread of gabagool, coffee, milk, juices, cheeses, smooth scrambled eggs, croissants, and more for us. They also made eggs/omelettes to order. So basically private chefs for breakfast. Really good. Obvious 5/5 because *private chefs for breakfast.* We ate until around 12:30PM. This is good because we woke up late as I finished journaling last night's entry at 3AM.

After breakfast, we just chilled and did a cooking class from 3PM to 5PM. I thought the cooking class was a "mid" 2/5 because the instructions were mostly in Italian and weren't very clear. The chef would have us make dough but didn't really explain how to incorporate the egg with flour, so the egg spilled everywhere. They kept telling us to roll and flatten out the dough, but with no real standardized way to do it, no pasta maker provided like in other cooking classes, so everyone made varying thickness of pasta (and their QC was not good enough to detect major differences, because it's unlikely the chefs use rolling pins manually to roll out pasta). Each table is taught a completely different technique.

But while Serena and I thought it was mid, other guests seemed to like it and thought it was fun.

Anyway, we eat our own cooking at around 6:30PM and it was terrible--the raviolis we made had dough that was way too thick and so it was quite gross.

The great thing about Serena is her foresight--she already calculated the possibility that we would hate the food we made and so she ordered a light dinner buffet anyways as backup. As a result, we were all able to eat until we were stuffed still.

After dinner, we took rounds saying our "byes" to guests. And both of our throats started to hurt.

## Part 3: Mini-Family Trip

We headed out to the Cinque Terre area together with Serena's family as one big group (16) people!

### April 21: Sick

Woke up feeling extremely tired with a pounding headache. We then got picked up by Serena's uncle who drove me to the next hotel we will stay at. Serena went with her aunts on a minibus, and there was another minibus to store everyone's (16 people's) luggage.

After around 90 minutes, we took a break at a cafe. We resumed our mini-road trip and another 90 minutes later arrived to [Capitolo Riviera](https://capitoloriviera.com/it/).

The place is pretty great. It's literally brand new, as one of Serena's aunt/uncle apparently can stay at *new* hotels, which is a pretty demanding requirement. This is a 5-star hotel with turndown service. 5/5. The food is excellent as well. I didn't have an appetite at the cafe due to cold chills but the food here was so good that it gave me an appetite again.

Anyways, it's good that the hotel had early check-in for all of us because we just slept right after lunch, and mostly didn't wake up other than to shower, take medicine, and eat some protein bars.

### April 22: Strep Throat?

Serena's aunt gave us some medicine the night before and it seemed to work well. Fever and headache completely gone. But my throat felt worse and it burns when I swallow food.

Anyways, being almost all better we went around Cinque Terre and did a cool cliff hike after a boat ride. After the hike was done, we went to town to eat a little bit. Then, we did a quick, 15 minute hike to look at some cliffs and sea, and then took a train ride to a fancy restaurant. We had:

* Scallops - 5/5, cooked perfectly with a nice, delicate and cheesy sauce.
* Small squid pasta - 5/5 - nicely al dente and the small squid was juicy.
* Catch of the day - 4/5 mostly because of price, but the potatos + soft fish was done fairly decently. Not too exciting though.
* Stockfish stew - 4/5 - fish + potatoes in stew style = good.
* Fish ravioli - 5/5 - they had a little sweet sauce on the ravioli which made the savory contrast really interesting.
* Apple tart - 5/5 - really excellent texture juxtapose between the soft apple tart cream and sponge-like cake, and the harder bottom kind of like a slightly softer Graham cracker.

After dinner, we headed back to the hotel and I did a bunch of resesarch on symptoms of:

* Sudden fever
* Sore throat with rashes
* No cough
* No runny nose

Strep? Will take a 'wait and see' approach to see if throat gets even more painful, if so will need to go through the annoying process of trying to get antibiotics prescription from Italian telehealth.

## Part 4: Honeymoon

When I think of honeymoon, I think of long vacations that are extra-special because you just got married. But for me it is hard to create that classification because Serena and I have been fortunate enough already to do month-long trips already in the past and we've already experienced many, very extra-special experiences. Though we of course try to enjoy the best of our vacation regardless.

### April 23: "Get on the boat" / Portofino 1

We checked out of Capitolo Riviera in the morning after having one final breakfast with Serena's family. We took off at around 12:15PM and arrived at [Villa Gelsomino Exclusive House](https://www.tripadvisor.it/ShowUserReviews-g187827-d21280031-r965416713-Villa_Gelsomino_Exclusive_House-Santa_Margherita_Ligure_Italian_Riviera_Liguria.html) 1PM.

Luckily, we get early check-in!

This isn't a 5-start hotel but the room is quite cute, with an intricately painted ceiling I stared at for a while because it looked interesting. It had various fruits on the 4 different sides of the ceiling, and the center of the ceiling is painted as a sunroof, with vines growing on the sunroof window frame.

The view is incredible, looking out into the village of Santa Margherita Ligure, and the nearby docks/Ligurian Sea.

Ever since we landed, most days has been cloudy. Except this one. The next day was supposed to be a bit cloudy as well, so Serena had the idea to book a private boat tour. This was at about 2:30PM. We scrambled looking for one, and Serena finally found one. By 3:30PM we were on the docks, meeting with the skipper. By 3:45PM we set off to sea.

He showed us everything from:

* A villa that Moussolini used to own, and now is owned by Louis Vuitton.
* A villa that Dolce Gabanna sold to Bill Gates, that he wants to turn into an expensive hotel.
* Various WW2 bunkers.
* More Louis Vuitton Villas.
* Superyachts owned by the Pirelli family (they make tires).
* A speed yacht owned by the guys that made Haribo.
* Various villas owned by people connected with the government. The iconic Louis Vuitton Villa is right next to the villa owned by the riches family in Italy as you enter Portofino by boat. Other words, these neighbors are: the richest family in Italy and the richest family in the world.
* A big villa under construction (right next to Bill Gate's) that's owned by a Russian oligarch. But has since been confiscated until the war ends.
* An iconic D&G castle, where the other Khardasian got married and apparently they also sponsored her dress.
* Stopped by Portofino. This is a small town with overpriced food but mostly is convenient for luxury shopping because Loro, Louis Vuitton, and all other LVMH brands. **For me, the best part is getting on a private boat without having to wait in a long line for a public ferry while all others watched in envy.** After all, why do things if not for the envy of others?
* Stopped by another place that can't really be gotten to be car, only via walking from Portofino for about  an hour and a half, or another nearby town for about 4 hours. It has a big mausoleum and a watch tower, as well as a monastery now-repurposed as restaurants/tourist services.

All in all, it was a really cool and wonderful experience and we headed back.

On the way back, the skipper took a 90-degree turn and just said "Dolphins!" And there were a bunch of dolphins swimming. We caught a few glimpses of a bunch of dolphins swimming around before we headed back.

After we dropped off our stuff at Villa Gelsomino, we headed out to eat. We ordered 5 pastas:

1. Appetizer is codfish with pea cream. 5/5 because the codfish is really soft and fluffy, like a potato. It's almost like they bashed it many times until it became very easy to bite into and fluffy, and reshaped it back into cod-shape.
2. Trofie with half cooked, half raw asparagus. 5/5. My mouth is filled with blisters, so this was one of the few things that can go down smoothly. We ordered this twice.
3. Red prawn spaghetti with tomato. 5/5. Prawn is carpaccio style.
4. Frutti di mare pasta - 3/5 - I don't remember much about this one.
5. Orechietta with guanciale - 5/5. Though it burned my tongue heavily because of the intense salt in the guanciale is literally like salt in my wounds (of which my entire mouth was).

All in all, 5/5 everything tasted really good and I'm sure even the pasta I don't remember tasted great. They put a lot of thought into the execution of every dish which is delightful.

We also went through 3.5 bottles of water because every bite hurt my mouth.

The damage for the 6 plates plus 3.5 bottles of water was about 120 euros.

My hands also started getting painful blisters, so the diagnosis is changed from steph to Hand-Foot-And-Mouth disease. This is much more manageable as it is simply viral and will go away in a week without complications.

But painful.

### April 24: Portofino 2

With great pain in my mouth, we ate breakfast at the villa. After, we set sail at around 12:15PM to Portofino.

We walked around a bit and then ate a fancy lunch at around 95 euro per person (3 course). Actually not too bad because the individual items I describe below would have cost much more per person:

1. Amuse Bouche - A small bread bite with avocado on the bottom and shrimp on the top. But these are hard to go wrong, so 5/5.
2. First course: Tuna spaghetti. Tuna made into strands and then twirled together, like a forkful of spaghetti. Dressed generously with a seafood-tasting cream. 5/5, very unique and delicious.
3. Second course: Stuffed very large rigatoni with tomato sauce. They give us giant cotton bibs so we won't splash ourselves with the tomato sauce. This is very thoughtful and nothing I've ever seen before. Tomato is acidic and burned my mouth a lot but well worth it. 5/5
4. Third course: Tiramisu. Nice and creamy. Sweet, but not too sweet. 5/5.

On the sides were various breads. I really liked the poppy-seed heavy bread even though it sliced my mouth (bread is hard). And their focaccia is the best I've ever had. This region invented focaccia and it shows.

Whole experience = 5/5.

We then went shopping. I stopped by Loro but didn't buy anything. While their jackets are cool they are not as functional for me:

* Their windmate bomber is reversable and waterproof and cashmere, which is cool. Except there's no hood so you still get soaked from your head if it rains.
* Their traveler has many pockets and seems to be made for traveling. This sounds cool and functional but there are no zip pockets, so securing items is not so secure after all. Also, while there is a hood, it is a bit flimsy and small, and not very practical for rain.

I don't mind getting a traveler-like jacket if they made it with better pockets and a sturdier hood with perhaps and extended hood, so water won't splash your eyes when it rains.

We did get some water from them though.

Next, we hit up BV and Serena got something. We also got water from them and they had really nice service. They locked the door so other customers couldn't get in while we were shopping, making it a very private shopping experience.

Or they locked us in so we couldn't leave without paying.

What is surprising to me is Portofino is a very wealthy city and there were many people walking around, but not many walked into luxury stores to buy stuff.

Another thing is that the night before, they did a celebration where they burned a bunch of trees to celebrate the saint that protects Portofino island (our tour guide pointed this out yesterday in the private boat tour as we were going ashore Portofino). So on this day, the huge mountain of trees we saw yesterday is now a bunch of hot, fuming ashes.

After some more walking around, we took the ferry home at 5PM.

5:30PM we ate at a pretty nicely priced restaurant. Pastas were in the teens which is very reasonable. We had:

* A big seafood soup, which was good (3.5/5) but hurt my mouth due to bones scraping against my blistered tongue.
* Spaghetti vongole - 5/5 - very generous with the clams and unlike the tart pomodoro sauce in the other spaghetti, this one didn't burn my mouth.
* Spaghetti frutti di mare - 5/5 - hard to critique good seafood with pasta that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

Walked around a little bit more in golden hour lighting and went back up to the villa and rested.

### April 25: Wow. Sanremo 1

Had breakfast at the villa. Enjoyed the beautiful view one last morning and set off at 11AM to a new town!

Drove around 2 hours and 40 minutes to Sanremo to beautiful [Royal Sanremo](https://www.royalhotelsanremo.com/?utm_source=gbp&utm_medium=organic). A true 5-star hotel. When I drove up the front door, 2 doorman opened both Serena and my door simultaneous, as if to pull us out of a car like kidnappings you see in the movie.

But instead, they helped take our luggages and park my car.

The downstairs of the hotel is beautiful. Wood floors with marbel columns, old money vibes. A bunch of luxury beachwear and luxury watches on display (only 1 small datejust rolex though). We had early check-in since + free upgrade since we booked with Amex plat. We dropped off our stuff in our immense hotel room with TWO FULL bathrooms (this is a first). I had a nepresso while waiting for luggage to come.

When they brought the luggage, they actually place the luggage on the luggage holders for us. This is pretty rare, even for 5-star hotels. Once that's done, we went down to the pool area of the hotel, which overlooks the Ligurian Sea. We just beach-bummed there and had a 33-euro burger with fries (4.5/5--fries were crisped really well and the burger was really nicely seasoned, the beef is locally sourced). Kind of small for the price, but we get a $100 credit from Amex Plat so that's generally how it works (food is overpriced but you still get a lot of it for free, so it takes a lot of the sting out of buying food in the hotel).

In our case, we weren't locked into hotel food as there were many affordable restaurants nearby despite the Monaco vibes.

I swam in their pool twice in the course of our 4-hour beach-bumming session. It was quite nice because it cools you off and there's a little nook where there is a large water column with moderate pressure that helps massage your back and any other joints you want to align to the column.

Even their public shower area has a separate makeup room...with a chair and a BLOWDRYER.

All in all it is a really awesome beach resort experience unlike any other. They made showering and drying off really convenient.

Their beach chairs also come with a little solid/adjustable umbrella so if you want to take a nap you won't get sunburned.

The whole thing is just so well thought out that while I don't rate resort beach experiences, it is a 6/5.

The weather was also killer with the beaming sun that made the ocean gleam and the waterfront look lively.

After beach bumming we decided to checkout their free spa before dinner. They have infinite juice/water to drink. There's a big jacuzzi pool where each section has their own different set of jets. There's also an 'emotional' shower where they randomly spray scents and spray you with different temperature water.

Emotional damage.

We also did the steam room which is quite nice. The sauna is only at 60C which is quite cool for a sauna and not very intense at all and was kind of boring.

After a quick shower and change of clothes, we did dinner at 7PM with a deadline to GTFO by 8:30PM. We had:

* A "small" seafood platter even though there were like a couple dozen pieces of seafood. From various types of clams to 2 small scarlett shrimps to 2 regular juicy shrimps. And 4 oysters. 5/5 - really insanely great deal for the value to be honest. I was shocked when they brought it out and was like "wtf this is piccolo? My Italian's not that bad."
* 2 seafood risottos - 4.5/5 - again, extremely generous and tasty. Further enhanced by the fact that my tongue does not hurt as much as the day before. Risotto could be more al dente but overall really good.
* Spaghetti alla carbonara - 5/5 - guanciale is yummy and chopped up into little pieces. The carbonara is extremely generous and is probably 2.5X the portion of a regular plate at any other traditional Trattoria's primi patti.

They also gave us free prosecco and a bunch of bread / bruschetta like snack for free. So 5/5, easy.

We went back to the hotel and I type this up now in the hotel lobby as we listen to live music where they play various songs, from Michael Jackson to "Get Lucky" by Daft Punk.

I went back up to the room to type this: there's also evening turndown service. Very good.

There's no air conditioning though as the hotel is on a central system and the season is currently seat to 'central heat' not 'central AC'.

**Hand foot mouth condition update:** hand blisters aren't as painful anymore. My tongue still hurts when eating food but only for the first 5 minutes and for hard foods and chocolate. For other foods, they don't seem to sting as much as yesterday where almost everything was like eating glass.

### April 26: Small towns are so good. Sanremo 2.

Woke up at around 9A and ate breakfast downstairs. It was really good. It's buffet style but what stands out are the freshly squeezed juice you can make yourself--they have an industrial sized juicer where you can put carrots, celery, or chopped apples into it.

Their scrambled eggs are also very creamy.

I ate plenty of food and desserts.

After breakfast, we went to beach bum again from around 11AM to 4PM. At 1PM, I took a gym break for about 40 minutes and went back to the pool area. We hopped into the water and swam until around 3:45PM. With wet swimware, we laid them out on the sun-tanning chairs to dry. We went back inside to order some burgers and club sandwich. It was expensive, but was very full after working on finishing it for about an hour. At around 5PM, we went to get gelato nearby.

It was false advertising though as though their signs showed flavors like gelato and rum, they didn't really have anything available outside of what is displayed in the gelato buckets you only see at the front of the line.

After our gelato trip, we checked on our swimwear and it was semi-wet. Doesn't matter though as we rotated into the spa area again, just like last night. This time the service was more extensive--they gave us a leather bucket with towels in it so we can set up an area to relax. We chilled until around 6:30PM and went back upstairs to get ready for dinner.

At 7PM we hit up a place called Flippers. They specialize in seafood like every other big restaurant at the seafront.

We had:

* A platter of mini (very mini) scarlett prawns. 3/5. A bit expensive, which is fine as this is an expensive ingredient (in San Sebastian it is like 45 euros for one giant scarlett prawn and Ramiro's in Lisbon is like 16 euros per prawn which is big sized but not giant sized). Still the best part about scarlet prawns are their head juice of which these are too small to have any.
* Spaghetti Langoustine (mini lobsters) with artichokes. The sauce is pretty interesting and the meat is pretty soft and sweet on the lobsters. 4/5. Some artichoke skin is too tough to chew. 
* Fettucine vongole e fish roe. This is perfect and the vongole's better than yesterday's even. Generous, yet the clams are much bigger so it is much meatier. Instead of 4 tiny clams where you need to work to get morsels of meat out of, these clams are huge and meaty and juicy. The sauce is also very seafoody and iron-y which tasted amazing. 5/5.
* For dessert we had pistaccio tiramisu. They presented the dessert with a big platter instead of from a menu. The pistaccio flavor felt a bit artificial but the tiramisu itself was excellent as far as texture and balance goes. 2.5/5.

Overall, the restaurant's 5/5 as they also gave free prosecco, free very fluffy bread, and a bruschetta-like snack. They also gave us a bib to eat the pasta so technicallly, 6/5. The restaurant felt very hot though so I hope I am not sick.

After dinner, we briefly walked around town and apparently there's a shopping street here and a huge casino. So we might check it out tomorrow.

We went back to the hotel and walked around a little bit, admiring the light fixtures which are all made with colorful, blown glass. There was live music for about 2 seconds but they went to take a break as soon as we went in, so we went back to our room to chill.

At our room, I realized why I am very warm: it's because **I'm sunburnt to fuck.** My back and shoulders is red. I had put on sunscreen in the morning, but as I wore a polo already I did not apply sunscreen to my shoulders and back. As such, when I went into the water for about an hour and change, I got roasted.

**Hands food mouth condition:** Same as yesterday, except fingertips are calloused so it is a bit awkward to play with my phone.

### April 27: Just Chill. Sanremo 3.

Woke up. Did breakfast, similar to yesterday.

After breakfast, we went out to the town to walk around (finally). Did a bunch of window shopping. The only thing we bought was at an Asian market (run by the only other Chinese person in this town), and it was 2 instant noodles so we can go back to the hotel and eat lunch.

The hotel didn't have forks, so we just used 2 coffee stirrers as makeshift chopsticks.

After lunch, we went back to the pool area for our usual beach bumming. We didn't go into the water today. Instead, we just took a bunch of pictures and napped. I also watched some Starcraft: Brood War tournament videos.

We then rotated into the spa, per usual. And we hung there until around 6:45PM.

Went back up to the room for a quick shower and headed out to [dinner at Quintessenza Restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps?q=Quintessenza+Restaurant,+Via+Giacomo+Matteotti,+5,+18038+Sanremo+IM,+Italy&ftid=0x12cdf54326dab9c9:0xbcc217c1c7f76c1&entry=gps&lucs=,94259550,47071704,47069508,94218641,47084304,94208458,94208447&g_ep=CAISDTYuMTAyLjMuNDI5MjAYACCenQoqPyw5NDI1OTU1MCw0NzA3MTcwNCw0NzA2OTUwOCw5NDIxODY0MSw0NzA4NDMwNCw5NDIwODQ1OCw5NDIwODQ0N0ICQVQ%3D&skid=0abf2209-5f0b-4f36-b63d-7d4d99899d6e&g_st=ic). Dinner was pretty good, we had:

* Seafood platter appetizer. It was quite good as there were various tartares--swordfish, tuna, salmon. And each small pile of tartare had different fruits underneath: blueberries, avocado, berries, respectively. There was also an oyster, some clams, one big prawn and one small scarlet prawn. There was also tuna slices in a cup. Served in some citrus-y sauce and soy sauce. Everything was good but the clam was a bit warm and sus--3.5/5.
* Tomato clam chowder. Unlike normal chowder, this is in a tomato base sauce. And they gave a bib to prevent splash. It was served in a mountain of mussels and clams, as well as toasted bread to soak in the broth. Very filling. 5/5.
* Langoustine Gnocchi. Nice and creamy with soft and pillowy gnocchi. Bits of langoustine adds a little bit of sweetness and variety in texture. 5/5.
* Rabbit Ravioli. The rabbit is similar to grounded turkey as it is more of a lean meat. Balanced out with a nice and creamy sauce and a heavy ravioli stuffed with cheese. 4.5/5.
* Octopus ink pasta with sea urching. It tasted mostly like a squid ink pasta that's seasoned quite well but I didn't detect any sea urchin. 2.5/5.

While they gave free bread and bruschetta, there was no free prosecco. So minus points there. But service was really good, so maybe it's a wash. I would say, overall: 4/5.

### April 28: Happy Birthday to My Wife! Piedmont 1.

We woke up early at around 7:30AM, and had a light breakfast as there's a 2 hour and 30 minute trek we gotta take soon.

After a good amount of pooping and packing, with heavy hearts we say goodbye to this wonderful 5-star hotel. They brought out our car quickly and helped us load our luggage.

We sat off and drove to [Casa Di Langa](https://www.casadilanga.com/) and arrived at around 12:40PM. On the way there, there were many 50km/h zones that didn't make sense...until I saw a motorcycle crash in front of us, then it made a lot of sense.

Many locals here love zipping around windy mountain roads dangerously on motorbikes, and doing illegal overtakes. Thus, if the Italian doesn't care about physical harm, they might care about financial harm. That's why they put very low speed limits and speed cameras everywhere.

Anyways, we arrived safely.

We were greeted with hot tea, they unloaded our luggage for us and brought it up to our room.

They also parked the car for us, as they do in 5-star hotels.

Apparently, since we booked this with Amex, we get:

* Late checkout
* Free room upgrade
* Early check-in
* $100 credit for food & beverage
* Free spa for 50 minutes (didn't know this)

So we booked the complimentary spa sessino for 4PM and took a bunch of pictures around the property. The property is very nice, overlooking huge a bunch of hills, and beautiful wineries. Their restaurant has their own greenhouse, and the property is 40+ acres large. They also have various art installations around the property so it is a nice touch.

Our room is amazing because they upgraded us and so we have probably the best view of the property. We overlook the same hills as the main area of the hotel with our balcony.

There is a heated stone in the bathroom so in case you're tired and like a warm butt, you can sit on the stone.

They have Le Labo (fancy brand) for the lotions and soaps, which is cool. Smells luxurious. And, they gave us **a bottle of free booze. Ouedis Brut (Enrico Serafino) 2020.** About a 25 euro bottle so it isn't the cheapest. The person that showed us the room said that if we wanted to swap out the brut with a iced sparkling wine, we can just call the front desk and they can swap it out for us.

Also, when showing us the property, they said the pool is closed but can open it for us if we want (though it isn't heated). I touched the water and, nah, we won't be swimming in it.

As I am typing this, there's Chromecast on the TV so I am simultaneously casting Brood War.

After much drinking, we headed out to dinner downstairs at around 7:20PM. Dinner was wonderful. It was a 5-course dinner and it was vegetarian. Normally, I'd treat this as a cardinal sin. However, it was done so well with great attention to detail that I'd have to give it a 5/5. In addition, the rate per person is only 90-euros so it is hard to complain (unlike 11 Madison which costs 4X lolol). The veggies were done very well, and it reminded me of Blue Hill at Stone Barns. I don't remember what all the ingredients are but my favorites are the fava bean + celery + herbs sorbet with a bunch of green stuff dish, and another ravioli dish where they used artichoke and foamed cheese (nice and gamey flavor like goat cheese, but because it is foam it isn't too heavy). The other stuff had many ingredients as well, and I don't remember what they are, so you'll just have to "trust me, bro" that [La Faula Restaurant](https://www.casadilanga.com/food-drink/faula/) is a 5/5.

We also ordered a 35-euro Rose and since we didn't finish it, Serena asked the waitress to deliver the unfinished Rose to the beautiful lounge where we could finish drinking it. They delivered it, put it on ice, and poured it for us which is great. I watched the faux fireplace (orange light shining on steam so it looks like flames) as I drank.

Once the drinks were finished, we admired the night view at both the premises and the balcony.

All in all, a wonderful property and a wonderful birthday for my wife.

### April 29: Overwhelmingly Green. Piedmont 2.

We woke up and had breakfast buffet. Ate for a couple hours, and it was nice because it's the first time that waiters asked if I wanted a refill for capuccino, *twice*, totaling 3 cups of cappucino.

After breakfast, we walked around the property a bit which was overwhelmingly green. The way the sun hits the surrounding hills and winery, it's just something that a camera is unable to capture (trust me, I tried many angles, zooms, exposures, etc. but nothing can capture the full vibe).

Went back to the room and just chilled until around 2PM. Then we checked out and made our way to [Castello Di Guarene](https://www.castellodiguarene.com/). This place is literally a castle. And was built in ~1700, which makes this place about 300 years old. It's gone through history from being a Unesco site to a castle where a family lived with a priest on site, only to be converted for tourism in 2011.

Old school vibe with glass blown chandeliers, and as the castle sits on a hill, overlooks surrounding hills where you can see rows of vineyards and town life from the room's balcony. At the top of the castle is a beautifully landscaped garden, and has 360-degree views of the all the surrounding hills. Utterly amazing, especially when the weather is good.

Underneath the castle is an underground escape tunnel, which is repurposed to lead guests into 2 spa areas:

1. A spa area with a heated pool, salt bath, foot massage, and free snacks.
2. Another area with a sauna, jacuzzi, cold room, turkish steam bath, and an emotional shower.

We spent almost 4 hours by ourselves across both spa areas as the castle seems to be mostly vacant. The privacy made it one of the most luxurious spa experiences we've had.

* The jacuzzi is nice because it's body temperature, which acts as a great buffer/reset of body temp if you get too cold or too hot.
* Once we did the jacuzzi, we did the sauna. I laid down for about 15 minutes and got very hot.
* So I hopped into the cold room where there's ice you can grab and rub yourself with to cool yourself down. It's also got stone chairs where you can sit so the cold stone can suck some of the temperature from you.
* After that, I did the emotional shower. There were 3 different modes. The first mode was fine, but because one shower uses so much water, I think they ran out of cold water. Because the 2nd and 3rd mode was scalding AF water only.
* Hopped into the jacuzzi again to reset my temperature.
* And then back to the sauna to dry myself off.
* And then to the cold room again to cool down a little bit.

Then we walked 150 meters across the tunnel to the other spa, where we went into the heated pool. The heated pool has a few sections: 

* A jacuzzi session where there are 3 chairs with jets. It is very good. And blew enough air in my trunks to inflate it / make me float.
* The water shooting section where high pressure water shoots out from a hose so you can massage yourself.
* A waterfall section where water falls from some artificial rocks so the gravity-pulled water can help massage your back.

Once we did that for a while, we did the foot massage which is just 2 shallow, long pools with rocks on the bottom. The first pool was nice and warm. And the 2nd pool is cold water. I did hot->cold->cold->hot for a total of 4 pools. The blood flow on my feet definitely got going after.

At this point we've finished playing with everything and got some free food from the snack area. In the snack area was a door leading to a large balcony outside with amazing views of the city. Clock towers, intensely green hills, rustic town houses scattered across the hills.

Once we're done with the spa we got back to our giant room to get ready for dinner. We showered and went to check out the 1st floor, where they had a garden that's so big it reminds me of the Boboli Gardens. The views from the garden's great. And you only get through there by going through a huge main room where the glass-blown chandelier is at least 2 stories tall. Utterly amazing.

We found our way to the dinner room and we both did a land-based pre fixe menu.

* Amuse bouche: A nice ricotta tart that's quite gamey like goat cheese. 5/5.
* Amuse bouche: Ragu of mushrooms, which is a mushroom-based cream with a bunch of mushrooms. Very umame and the flavor was intense. The texture's nice and creamy but not too loose. 5/5.
* 1st course: Baby veal with a variety of sauces. Veal is very lean and so it relied on the sauces. The sauces tasted like canned tuna and other not-very-memorable flavors. It's a bit forced, so 3/5.
* 2nd course: Rabbit/pork/chicken ravioli, served in a wrapped napkin. It is served in this style because this is how miners used to eat these raviolis, and the napkins help them protect the food from the garbage falling from the ceiling above. Nice, intense flavors. Mid presentation but I admire the boldness. The ravioli while beautiful has a bit too thick of a dough. 4/5.
* 3rd course: Guinea fowl 2 ways: breast and thigh. Served with a coffee sauce and a ricotta/parm sauce. And some yummy cheesy veggies. Overall it is nice, as the thick cheese balances nicely with the bitter coffee sauce. And the lean breast balances out with the fatty thigh. Portion could be bigger though and the breast is meh, could have just served 2 thighs. 4/5.
* Palette cleanser: Peach sorbet with crumbles. Very peachy. 5/5.
* Dessert: Ice cream with crumbles, chocolate honeycomb, coffee jelly, and a egg-yolk based foam. Very good. 5/5.

Overall, I'd give this place a 4.2/5. Some hit or misses. But service is very slow (2 hours) for not a lot of dishes, and the portions were small, even for a tasting menu.

After dinner we walked around a bit and ran into a chatty hotel worker. He explained to us the history of the castle and asked us where we are from. He seems disgruntled with working in Europe as "you get punished trying to do more just the same as trying to do less" and want to move elsewhere. But I'd argue this isn't a EU vs. US thing--it's a life thing. Sure, in some small startups or if you start your own business in the US, it can be merit based. But most companies in the US is politics-based and the more you disrupt the status quo, the more trouble you get into, no matter how good your intentions.

And I find it funny that the current meta is:

* Americans want to move to Europe, because "life is less stressful and happier in Europe."
* Europeans want to move to America, because "works sucks in Europe and there are more opportunities in America."

The grass is always greener on the other side, and with the advent of the internet, it seems like we're never satisfied with where we are, even though opportunities to live a good life is more or less democratized across 1st-world countries.

## Lessons Learned

* When we got on the boat on April 23rd, that was completely spontaneous. And on April 24th, it was a bit cloudier and windier. It would have not been great to get on the boat the next day. It goes to show that **if an opportunity arises, you must always be ready and capitalize on it immediately.**
* **You can / should just ask people to do things.** It might seem odd or unreasonable to ask staff to deliver an unfinished, cheap bottle of wine to the main lobby in front of the bar so we can finish drinking it. But you never know if you don't ask. And in so asking, we saved ourselves a lot of alcohol money and still was able to enjoy the vibe of the Casa Di Langa lounge without paying an extra dime.
