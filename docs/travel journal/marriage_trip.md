# 2025 The Marriage Trip

## Overview

This is a 4 week trip. Primary purpose is to get married / have a travel destination wedding in Italy.

April 13 to May 12 2025, inclusive.

## Part 1: Florence

### April 13 - 14

We flew Emirates business class in JFK -> MXP.

Food in lounge is quite delicious and Emirates business class lounge is quite spacious. They had everything from checken legs to (small) lamb chops, to desserts of various kinds.

5-6 plates of small food later, we boarded our Emirates business class. This A380 is nice and I spent most of it not sleeping. The lounge was cool but unlike the A380 I flew SFO->DXB, there's no desk setup that makes it feel like a private jet.

The food on the plane was very good, from Chilean Sea Bass to Osso Bucco. Med meats are always kind of Mid Meats, because they are kind of dry. But overall, delicious. For booze, I just had an espresso martini and a Glenmorangie.

A movie and a nap later, we had breakfast. It as a lobster omelette with croissants, breads, and coffee. Good, 3.5/5, wished they had more lobster in the omelette though.

Getting through customs was fast. And by the time we got to luggage claim, all 3 of our luggages were there. I've never retrieved my luggage this quickly. After we speedrun the luggage claim, which took all of 10-20 seconds, we went to our restroom and met our private driver who drove us 4 hours from MXP to Firenze.

We met up with Serena's friends for dinner and ate a lot.

Better than I've eaten in a long time. And it's been a very long time since I've had good, authentic Italian food. From linguini pasta with an amazing sauce to well-balanced, heavy Italian dumplings, to mushroom pasta, to a mountain of Tiramisu, it was all really good.

What's even better is the service: they gave us a bunch of free food on the side, and on top of that they had this really amazing spicy sauce you can slobber all over your food.

On the way to the restaurant, we took the bus but on the way back, there were no more busses so we walked in the rain for about 30 minutes to get back to the hotel.

### April 15

Couldn't really sleep due to jetlag. Slept from maybe 5AM to 9:30AM.

Went out to meet Serena's friends to eat lunch at a place called Trattoria Sergio Gozzi. It was really good. We had:

* Beef stew - 2/5 too salty but sauce was good.
* Pork chop - 3/5 average.
* Pastas - 3/5 average. Not al dente enough.
* Liver - 6/5 so juicy, so moist. Just like fois gras.
* House wine - 4/5, more sour than full-bodied. Very nice to cut through the gamey liver and meats.
* Overall: 4/5, the liver + wine really slaps.

I ended up eating the most as usual. Even more than the pregnant woman at the table. Did everyone else eat anorexic amounts, or do I eat too much?

Walked around and took some photos outside the Duomo. We also did some afternoon espresso, which was followed by a quick Merry Go Around stop at the city center.

We walked around a little bit more and then did afternoon tea/coffee in the city center, next to the Merry Go Around. Half of Serena's friends went back home to sleep, another stayed with us to walk around a bit more, including a trip to [Cantina del Gelato, which we always visit in Florence](../italy_2023).

At around 7PM, we made our way to a restaurant inside Hotel Hermitage. Famous for truffles, maybe? Had:

* Pasta with regular truffle - 1/5, was like pasta boiled in water only. No taste.
* Pasta with winter truffle - 3/5, had some truffle flavor but still bland.
* Osso buco - 4/5 - Good flavor, falls apart nicely.
* Chicken breast with lemon sauce - 4/5 - I really liked the lemon sauce as it was nice and tart, which is nice to eat with meats. The chicken breast itself was moist which is hard to do.
* Chicken breast with truffle - 4/5 - Also moist chicken breast and the truffle adds a little bit to the sauce.
* Beef tartare - 5/5. It also had truffle that I can barely taste but beef tartare always tastes good.
* Slices of beef - 3.5/5. These are like thin slices of raw steak which is nice, and showered with truffle. But the truffle had zero taste compared to the beef tartare.
* Fettucine ragu - 4/5 - Ragu nicely flavored, nice contrast to bland AF truffle dishes.
* Overall - 3/5. Slow-ish service and quite expensive for what it was.

Then we went to Cantina del Gelato again. Their gelato is nice, creamy, and smooth unlike many other places that are maybe too dense, too sweet, or just lacks a je nais se quois.

Walked back home (no rain today, yay) for about 30 mins.

### April 16

Slept poorly. Woke at 2AM. Went to sleep at 5AM. Woke up again at 8:30AM. Went to go pick up our rental car near SMN.

We got a car upgrade because of Amex plat, and we landed a blue Renault Australe. It has a range of 1050km (about 680+ miles) which is ridiculous.

After that, we went to eat at Sabatino's, one of Anthony Bourdain's recommendations. They do simple, local, and affordable food. We had:

* Papardelle pasta 5/5 - al dente, creamy and savory.
* Pork liver - 5/5, not as juicy and tender's as yesterday's, but really nice dense flavors and pairs well with their wine and sides.
* Radish and leeks as sides - 5/5 - nice, fresh, and crunchy, it goes really well with the heavy food / pasta that we had. The leeks had a little bit of a spice to it, like eating raw onions, so this made all the food even better.
* Guinea Fowl - I thought this was rabbit due to ChatGPT translation, but it was just a very lean chicken. 3/5. A little dry but not bad overall.
* Boiled chicken with stuffed pistachios - 4/5, good.
* Wine - 5/5. More on the sour side like yesterday's house red, but the way it paired with the rest of the meal was really good. Moreover, it was only 1.5 euros which is the cheapest I've ever paid for wine I think.
* Americano 4/5 - OK.
* Desserts - 3.5/5 - we had a couple of pastries, not too sweet but not so great as to write home about.

Then, we walked to the Florence market and had lampredotto at a place called Da Nerbone. The place is popular due to it being in business since 1873. So we waited in line for 35 minutes before we got our pig stomach plate + panini. It was 5/5 good but including wait time 2/5 -- wouldn't wait just for this.

We walked around a bit more and did window shopping. Once we finished buying absolutely nothing, we went to get a gelato at a new, hip place. They had spicy Mayan chocolate which tastes like a smooth, creamy chocolate gelato at the start but the after taste comes with smoke! 5/5.

Went home and chilled; wanted to lift weights. They only had one of those all-in-one machines and while not ideal, it was also completely broken so I can't lift anything. We instead found a nice terrace to practice our first dance. But the whole terrace was so ridden with bed bugs that we only practiced twice.

Took a shower, chilled for a bit, went out to dinner at Trattoria Osteria Dall'oste. We had:

* T-bone steaks, 5/5 - good cook on it.
* Various parma hams - 4/5 - a bit too salty after eating too much.
* Truffle pasta - 4/5 - much more truffle than yesterday's "truffle" pasta.
* Steak tartare - 5/5. Good with a nicely salted egg yolk.
* Carpaccio - 3.5/5 - good but not that much meat flavors.
* Some rigatoni - 3/5 - good.
* Papardelle - 4/5 - good, nice and creamy.

Too full, went home after.

## April 17

Good sleep. Woke up at 6A then slept again until 11:30AM. About 11 hours of sleep.

Met up with Serena's friends and ate lunch.

Went home and chilled. Had a bit of a stomach ache. Had:

* Carbonara - 4/5 - was good and the guanciale was good. Maybe a little tough and not as fatty as the best guanciale.
* Beef tartare - 5/5 - sweet caramelized onions + cheese in the middle of the tartare really put it over the top.
* Overall: 4/5

Went back home and chilled. This is more of a recovery day as we are trying to save energy to do the whole wedding thing.

Went back out for dinner at a famous place called Il Lattini. It was trash. We had the family meal:

* Parma ham and meats which is OK, 3/5.
* Unknown sides were given to us, which were all very salty. 2/5.
* Steak: 1/5 - they insist on cooking it rare but their meat is too lean to cook rare. So it had the same effect as overcooked meat: way too tough and rubbery. My jaw had a harder workout going through this meat than an OF model going through their meat on a shoot. What a waste.
* Dessert: Tiramisu and other stuff, 4/5 but at this point we were all tired and sort of turned off by the food and service (which was very slow).

I had to ask 3 times before I could get fork + knife utensils to eat the steak with. Overall: 1/5. Not sure why the internet hyped it up. This place is the closest in making me hate food.

## Part 2: Getting Married / Villa Cini

### April 18

After mysteriously stabbing my finger on a luggage while checking out of our hotel in Florence, we drove to pick up Serena's pregnant friend.

Then, with much restraint, I drove to Villa Cini, the Villa we'll get married at.

Serena went to do her makeup and once everything's settled in, guests started arriving. After I welcomed them to their rooms, it was almost time for the welcome dinner.

We were deciding between indoor and outdoors as there's 20% chance of rain. But it was so nice outside that we risked it and it ended up not raining. And there was even 20 minutes of golden hour photos to be taken.

For the welcome dinner, we had:

* Endless pizza - 5/5, they had everything from pepperoni pizza to truffle pizza to everything else. As they have a very nice mobile pizza oven, everything was baked fresh and delicious.
* Endless gelato - 5/5. Hard to complain about gelato.
* Red wine - 5/5 - actually a bit more full bodied, sweeter, and easy to go down than house wine by a lot. Not bad. People asked us if we tasted the wine before and the question itself is giving us too much credit probably. But I'm glad the wine tastes good.

At the welcome dinner, 2 of Serena's friends revealed they were pregnant (we already knew though). And my friends arrived as well!

Later, I was talking about how I had to drive slow because there's a pregnant woman in my car (referring to Sally's friend). My neighbor mistook this to mean Serena was pregnant, which I'd find out later in a pool game.

After welcome dinner, Serena's family threw a huge and elaborate surprise for her. It consisted of:

* A competition where we have a bunch of people's faces, shredded in strips. And first one to put Serena's face together wins.
* A roundtable about what each family unit on Serena's side thinks she will be when she grows up.
* A roundable about what each family unit on Serena's side likes most about Serena.
* A binder of childhood photos gifted to Serena.
* A gift of a mirror and a jewelry box. The jewelry box is then filled with 3 notes per family unit so Serena can take a look over a long time to see the love her family has for her.

After that's done, they prepared fruits in our bedroom and I went down to play pool by myself a little bit. There were also fruit flies so I put the fruit in the fridge downstairs.

As I was playing a little bit of pool by myself, I heard some talking outside and flashlight outside. Turns out my cousin's family + my brother came over and wanted to play as well. So we played for a bit.

After playing for an hour and only hitting 3 balls in, we gave up and they went up and I went upstairs to sleep.

### April 19: Best Day Of My Life

I woke up at around 830AM and went downstairs to pay the baker who dropped off a bunch of croissants. Serena's friend's husband cooked me instant noodles. Toasted the croissants at 100C and ate those toasty croissants.

After breakfast, I went for a swim at the pool. It was somewhat of a mistake because while the weather is 50F and my thinking was that "it won't be that cold when I get out of the water," I neglected to think about just how fucking cold 50F water is, with its immense thermal conductivity. I dove in and almost went numb immediately. I thought that I could generate internal heat to offset the cold, but even after 5 minutes of intense swimming when my heart was sprinting, my skin feels like it was being burned by the cold. I showered after that and we did a photoshoot at 12:45PM with "the boys." They consisted of my cousin, brother, and friend. After the photoshoot, we played some pool until 1:30PM and then did a "first look" photoshoot at 2PM.

After the photoshoot, we got ready for the ceremony.

We did some beautiful ass vows. And we got married. We did a sand ceremony thing where we intertwined ourselves by pouring different colored sands into a bottle. The ceremony was perfect because it was close, intimate group of people. And the weather was perfect, and the flowers were nice and pastel and fresh and perfect. It was raining *all week* and this was the only day where it was nice and had a good amount of sun, without being too hot.

After the ceremony and photos, it was around 4PM and we did aperitifs. I had:

* Parma Ham: 5/5 - it is as good as any parma ham.
* Fried goods - 5/5 - it is fresh fried and hot.
* Quail egg on toast with truffles - 5/5 because you can read, right?
* Wines - 5/5 - same wine as yesterday.

Right after apertifs, we did an entrance at 6PM to do the reception dinner so that the risotto can come out perfeclty at 6:15PM. I did an improvised toast that was apparently touching because it made Serena cry. And then we had:

* Risotto - 5/5, actually done correctly and boldly al dente. I hate soggy risotto.
* Ravioli with stuffed pork - 5/5: moist, juicy, savory. The amount was only 2 large raviolis and the presentation was meh, but the taste was amazing.
* Florentine steak with sides. The great thing about the steak was that they keep going around with various cooks and you can get as many pieces as you want. The first round was well-done mandatory, so 4.5/5, but I was able to eat a round of "very rare" which is wayyyy better than Il Latini, as it was thinly sliced and smooth--but I was unable to enjoy more round as we were called into doing a Golden Hour photoshoot.
* Dessert was the wedding cake which was very nice and moist. Sweet, but not too sweet.

After dinner, at around 8:30PM, we went to practice our first dance in our room for 2 reps. Then, we went back out and Serena did her bouquet throwing, where Serena's sister Lorraine forced it into one of her friends after catching it. By this time, we did our first dance at 9:10PM after waiting for Serena's mom to change her dress, and we executed it PERFECTLY.

This is a miracle because I forget some parts a lot of times, but the warmups help my neural networks to execute the dance moves perfectly.

We literally danced and danced, until more and more people left, as they do.

But unlike most wedding dances where it lasts for maybe 30-90 mins, many stayed until 11:30PM/12AM. One of the main things that helped was the weather. It was more chilly so it enabled people to dance more as their generated heat offsets the cold. Whereas a summer wedding, you'd usually see folks almost pass out after 20 minutes of intense dancing. It was kind of interesting because as Serena's sister and cousin danced, you can see that they got progressively more drunk and would hug and mutter "I love you"s to you. It was strange but flattering. 

I guess I'm a good dancer because I got compliments about how I'm the best dancer from:

* Our wedding planner's assistant
* My friends
* The DJ
* Most everyone else

More and more left until Serena's last high school friends wanted to leave. Then a blackpink song came on and I pulled one of Serena's high school friends to do one more dance with me. I asked:

> Are your friends waiting for you?

And showed me her car keys and said

> They can't leave without me

To which I laughed immensely and kept dancing.

At the end, the sole survivors were just Serena and I dancing like we're on ecstasy from 12AM to 12:40AM on the dance floor with the DJ blasting music. This ecstasy of dancing with my wife, with a private DJ, lights shining on us, is one of the highlights of my life.

Overall, I'm very happy and one of my friends told me it's the best wedding she ever went to. And it seems like everyone had a great time without any drama. The food was good and booze was abundant.

This is the best day of my life and I hope I don't forget a single moment of it. Though it'll be hard as I've had a lot to drink.
