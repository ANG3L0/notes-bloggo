# 2025 The Marriage Trip

## Overview

This is a 4 week trip. Primary purpose is to get married / have a travel destination wedding in Italy.

April 13 to May 12 2025, inclusive.

## Part 1: Florence

### April 13 - 14

We flew Emirates business class in JFK -> MXP.

Food in lounge is quite delicious and Emirates business class lounge is quite spacious. They had everything from checken legs to (small) lamb chops, to desserts of various kinds.

5-6 plates of small food later, we boarded our Emirates business class. This A380 is nice and I spent most of it not sleeping. The lounge was cool but unlike the A380 I flew SFO->DXB, there's no desk setup that makes it feel like a private jet.

The food on the plane was very good, from Chilean Sea Bass to Osso Bucco. Med meats are always kind of Mid Meats, because they are kind of dry. But overall, delicious. For booze, I just had an espresso martini and a Glenmorangie.

A movie and a nap later, we had breakfast. It as a lobster omelette with croissants, breads, and coffee. Good, 3.5/5, wished they had more lobster in the omelette though.

Getting through customs was fast. And by the time we got to luggage claim, all 3 of our luggages were there. I've never retrieved my luggage this quickly. After we speedrun the luggage claim, which took all of 10-20 seconds, we went to our restroom and met our private driver who drove us 4 hours from MXP to Firenze.

We met up with Serena's friends for dinner and ate a lot.

Better than I've eaten in a long time. And it's been a very long time since I've had good, authentic Italian food. From linguini pasta with an amazing sauce to well-balanced, heavy Italian dumplings, to mushroom pasta, to a mountain of Tiramisu, it was all really good.

What's even better is the service: they gave us a bunch of free food on the side, and on top of that they had this really amazing spicy sauce you can slobber all over your food.

On the way to the restaurant, we took the bus but on the way back, there were no more busses so we walked in the rain for about 30 minutes to get back to the hotel.

### April 15

Couldn't really sleep due to jetlag. Slept from maybe 5AM to 9:30AM.

Went out to meet Serena's friends to eat lunch at a place called Trattoria Sergio Gozzi. It was really good. We had:

* Beef stew - 2/5 too salty but sauce was good.
* Pork chop - 3/5 average.
* Pastas - 3/5 average. Not al dente enough.
* Liver - 6/5 so juicy, so moist. Just like fois gras.
* House wine - 4/5, more sour than full-bodied. Very nice to cut through the gamey liver and meats.
* Overall: 4/5, the liver + wine really slaps.

I ended up eating the most as usual. Even more than the pregnant woman at the table. Did everyone else eat anorexic amounts, or do I eat too much?

Walked around and took some photos outside the Duomo. We also did some afternoon espresso, which was followed by a quick Merry Go Around stop at the city center.

We walked around a little bit more and then did afternoon tea/coffee in the city center, next to the Merry Go Around. Half of Serena's friends went back home to sleep, another stayed with us to walk around a bit more, including a trip to [Cantina del Gelato, which we always visit in Florence](../italy_2023).

At around 7PM, we made our way to a restaurant inside Hotel Hermitage. Famous for truffles, maybe? Had:

* Pasta with regular truffle - 1/5, was like pasta boiled in water only. No taste.
* Pasta with winter truffle - 3/5, had some truffle flavor but still bland.
* Osso buco - 4/5 - Good flavor, falls apart nicely.
* Chicken breast with lemon sauce - 4/5 - I really liked the lemon sauce as it was nice and tart, which is nice to eat with meats. The chicken breast itself was moist which is hard to do.
* Chicken breast with truffle - 4/5 - Also moist chicken breast and the truffle adds a little bit to the sauce.
* Beef tartare - 5/5. It also had truffle that I can barely taste but beef tartare always tastes good.
* Slices of beef - 3.5/5. These are like thin slices of raw steak which is nice, and showered with truffle. But the truffle had zero taste compared to the beef tartare.
* Fettucine ragu - 4/5 - Ragu nicely flavored, nice contrast to bland AF truffle dishes.
* Overall - 3/5. Slow-ish service and quite expensive for what it was.

Then we went to Cantina del Gelato again. Their gelato is nice, creamy, and smooth unlike many other places that are maybe too dense, too sweet, or just lacks a je nais se quois.

Walked back home (no rain today, yay) for about 30 mins.

### April 16

Slept poorly. Woke at 2AM. Went to sleep at 5AM. Woke up again at 8:30AM. Went to go pick up our rental car near SMN.

We got a car upgrade because of Amex plat, and we landed a blue Renault Australe. It has a range of 1050km (about 680+ miles) which is ridiculous.

After that, we went to eat at Sabatino's, one of Anthony Bourdain's recommendations. They do simple, local, and affordable food. We had:

* Papardelle pasta 5/5 - al dente, creamy and savory.
* Pork liver - 5/5, not as juicy and tender's as yesterday's, but really nice dense flavors and pairs well with their wine and sides.
* Radish and leeks as sides - 5/5 - nice, fresh, and crunchy, it goes really well with the heavy food / pasta that we had. The leeks had a little bit of a spice to it, like eating raw onions, so this made all the food even better.
* Guinea Fowl - I thought this was rabbit due to ChatGPT translation, but it was just a very lean chicken. 3/5. A little dry but not bad overall.
* Boiled chicken with stuffed pistachios - 4/5, good.
* Wine - 5/5. More on the sour side like yesterday's house red, but the way it paired with the rest of the meal was really good. Moreover, it was only 1.5 euros which is the cheapest I've ever paid for wine I think.
* Americano 4/5 - OK.
* Desserts - 3.5/5 - we had a couple of pastries, not too sweet but not so great as to write home about.

Then, we walked to the Florence market and had lampredotto at a place called Da Nerbone. The place is popular due to it being in business since 1873. So we waited in line for 35 minutes before we got our pig stomach plate + panini. It was 5/5 good but including wait time 2/5 -- wouldn't wait just for this.

We walked around a bit more and did window shopping. Once we finished buying absolutely nothing, we went to get a gelato at a new, hip place. They had spicy Mayan chocolate which tastes like a smooth, creamy chocolate gelato at the start but the after taste comes with smoke! 5/5.

Went home and chilled; wanted to lift weights. They only had one of those all-in-one machines and while not ideal, it was also completely broken so I can't lift anything. We instead found a nice terrace to practice our first dance. But the whole terrace was so ridden with bed bugs that we only practiced twice.

Took a shower, chilled for a bit, went out to dinner at Trattoria Osteria Dall'oste. We had:

* T-bone steaks, 5/5 - good cook on it.
* Various parma hams - 4/5 - a bit too salty after eating too much.
* Truffle pasta - 4/5 - much more truffle than yesterday's "truffle" pasta.
* Steak tartare - 5/5. Good with a nicely salted egg yolk.
* Carpaccio - 3.5/5 - good but not that much meat flavors.
* Some rigatoni - 3/5 - good.
* Papardelle - 4/5 - good, nice and creamy.

Too full, went home after.

## April 17

Good sleep. Woke up at 6A then slept again until 11:30AM. About 11 hours of sleep.

Met up with Serena's friends and ate lunch.

Went home and chilled. Had a bit of a stomach ache. Had:

* Carbonara - 4/5 - was good and the guanciale was good. Maybe a little tough and not as fatty as the best guanciale.
* Beef tartare - 5/5 - sweet caramelized onions + cheese in the middle of the tartare really put it over the top.
* Overall: 4/5

Went back home and chilled. This is more of a recovery day as we are trying to save energy to do the whole wedding thing.

Went back out for dinner at a famous place called Il Lattini. It was trash. We had the family meal:

* Parma ham and meats which is OK, 3/5.
* Unknown sides were given to us, which were all very salty. 2/5.
* Steak: 1/5 - they insist on cooking it rare but their meat is too lean to cook rare. So it had the same effect as overcooked meat: way too tough and rubbery. My jaw had a harder workout going through this meat than an OF model going through their meat on a shoot. What a waste.
* Dessert: Tiramisu and other stuff, 4/5 but at this point we were all tired and sort of turned off by the food and service (which was very slow).

I had to ask 3 times before I could get fork + knife utensils to eat the steak with. Overall: 1/5. Not sure why the internet hyped it up. This place is the closest in making me hate food.

## Part 2: Getting Married / Villa Cini

### April 18

After mysteriously stabbing my finger on a luggage while checking out of our hotel in Florence, we drove to pick up Serena's pregnant friend.

Then, with much restraint, I drove to Villa Cini, the Villa we'll get married at.

Serena went to do her makeup and once everything's settled in, guests started arriving. After I welcomed them to their rooms, it was almost time for the welcome dinner.

We were deciding between indoor and outdoors as there's 20% chance of rain. But it was so nice outside that we risked it and it ended up not raining. And there was even 20 minutes of golden hour photos to be taken.

For the welcome dinner, we had:

* Endless pizza - 5/5, they had everything from pepperoni pizza to truffle pizza to everything else. As they have a very nice mobile pizza oven, everything was baked fresh and delicious.
* Endless gelato - 5/5. Hard to complain about gelato.
* Red wine - 5/5 - actually a bit more full bodied, sweeter, and easy to go down than house wine by a lot. Not bad. People asked us if we tasted the wine before and the question itself is giving us too much credit probably. But I'm glad the wine tastes good.

At the welcome dinner, 2 of Serena's friends revealed they were pregnant (we already knew though). And my friends arrived as well!

Later, I was talking about how I had to drive slow because there's a pregnant woman in my car (referring to Sally's friend). My neighbor mistook this to mean Serena was pregnant, which I'd find out later in a pool game.

After welcome dinner, Serena's family threw a huge and elaborate surprise for her. It consisted of:

* A competition where we have a bunch of people's faces, shredded in strips. And first one to put Serena's face together wins.
* A roundtable about what each family unit on Serena's side thinks she will be when she grows up.
* A roundable about what each family unit on Serena's side likes most about Serena.
* A binder of childhood photos gifted to Serena.
* A gift of a mirror and a jewelry box. The jewelry box is then filled with 3 notes per family unit so Serena can take a look over a long time to see the love her family has for her.

After that's done, they prepared fruits in our bedroom and I went down to play pool by myself a little bit. There were also fruit flies so I put the fruit in the fridge downstairs.

As I was playing a little bit of pool by myself, I heard some talking outside and flashlight outside. Turns out my cousin's family + my brother came over and wanted to play as well. So we played for a bit.

After playing for an hour and only hitting 3 balls in, we gave up and they went up and I went upstairs to sleep.

### April 19: Best Day Of My Life

I woke up at around 830AM and went downstairs to pay the baker who dropped off a bunch of croissants. Serena's friend's husband cooked me instant noodles. Toasted the croissants at 100C and ate those toasty croissants.

After breakfast, I went for a swim at the pool. It was somewhat of a mistake because while the weather is 50F and my thinking was that "it won't be that cold when I get out of the water," I neglected to think about just how fucking cold 50F water is, with its immense thermal conductivity. I dove in and almost went numb immediately. I thought that I could generate internal heat to offset the cold, but even after 5 minutes of intense swimming when my heart was sprinting, my skin feels like it was being burned by the cold. I showered after that and we did a photoshoot at 12:45PM with "the boys." They consisted of my cousin, brother, and friend. After the photoshoot, we played some pool until 1:30PM and then did a "first look" photoshoot at 2PM.

After the photoshoot, we got ready for the ceremony.

We did some beautiful ass vows. And we got married. We did a sand ceremony thing where we intertwined ourselves by pouring different colored sands into a bottle. The ceremony was perfect because it was close, intimate group of people. And the weather was perfect, and the flowers were nice and pastel and fresh and perfect. It was raining *all week* and this was the only day where it was nice and had a good amount of sun, without being too hot.

After the ceremony and photos, it was around 4PM and we did aperitifs. I had:

* Parma Ham: 5/5 - it is as good as any parma ham.
* Fried goods - 5/5 - it is fresh fried and hot.
* Quail egg on toast with truffles - 5/5 because you can read, right?
* Wines - 5/5 - same wine as yesterday.

Right after apertifs, we did an entrance at 6PM to do the reception dinner so that the risotto can come out perfeclty at 6:15PM. I did an improvised toast that was apparently touching because it made Serena cry. And then we had:

* Risotto - 5/5, actually done correctly and boldly al dente. I hate soggy risotto.
* Ravioli with stuffed pork - 5/5: moist, juicy, savory. The amount was only 2 large raviolis and the presentation was meh, but the taste was amazing.
* Florentine steak with sides. The great thing about the steak was that they keep going around with various cooks and you can get as many pieces as you want. The first round was well-done mandatory, so 4.5/5, but I was able to eat a round of "very rare" which is wayyyy better than Il Latini, as it was thinly sliced and smooth--but I was unable to enjoy more round as we were called into doing a Golden Hour photoshoot.
* Dessert was the wedding cake which was very nice and moist. Sweet, but not too sweet.

After dinner, at around 8:30PM, we went to practice our first dance in our room for 2 reps. Then, we went back out and Serena did her bouquet throwing, where Serena's sister Lorraine forced it into one of her friends after catching it. By this time, we did our first dance at 9:10PM after waiting for Serena's mom to change her dress, and we executed it PERFECTLY.

This is a miracle because I forget some parts a lot of times, but the warmups help my neural networks to execute the dance moves perfectly.

We literally danced and danced, until more and more people left, as they do.

But unlike most wedding dances where it lasts for maybe 30-90 mins, many stayed until 11:30PM/12AM. One of the main things that helped was the weather. It was more chilly so it enabled people to dance more as their generated heat offsets the cold. Whereas a summer wedding, you'd usually see folks almost pass out after 20 minutes of intense dancing. It was kind of interesting because as Serena's sister and cousin danced, you can see that they got progressively more drunk and would hug and mutter "I love you"s to you. It was strange but flattering. 

I got super drunk and bumped into one of Serena's friends and got red wine all over my suit. While the suit is expensive, it kind of doesn't matter because I realize my suit is never really going to be worn again (I work remote, and even if I don't, I'm in tech so the only time I wear suits is at people's wedding and I have other, higher quality, suits already).

Later on, one of Serena's friends picked the Gulu Gulu theme (Hong Kong cartoon from way long ago)--it is one of my favorite childhood cartoons so I danced the shit out of it.

I guess I'm a good dancer because I got compliments about how I'm the best dancer from:

* Our wedding planner's assistant
* My friends
* The DJ
* Most everyone else

More and more left until Serena's last high school friends wanted to leave. Then a blackpink song came on and I pulled one of Serena's high school friends to do one more dance with me. I asked:

> Are your friends waiting for you?

And showed me her car keys and said

> They can't leave without me

To which I laughed immensely and kept dancing.

At the end, the sole survivors were just Serena and I dancing like we're on ecstasy from 12AM to 12:40AM on the dance floor with the DJ blasting music. This ecstasy of dancing with my wife, with a private DJ, lights shining on us, is one of the highlights of my life.

Overall, I'm very happy and one of my friends told me it's the best wedding she ever went to. And it seems like everyone had a great time without any drama. The food was good and booze was abundant.

This is the best day of my life and I hope I don't forget a single moment of it. Though it'll be hard as I've had a lot to drink.

### April 20: Cooking Class

On this day, we had breakfast at the villa. A few chefs came and basically laid out a huge spread of gabagool, coffee, milk, juices, cheeses, smooth scrambled eggs, croissants, and more for us. They also made eggs/omelettes to order. So basically private chefs for breakfast. Really good. Obvious 5/5 because *private chefs for breakfast.* We ate until around 12:30PM. This is good because we woke up late as I finished journaling last night's entry at 3AM.

After breakfast, we just chilled and did a cooking class from 3PM to 5PM. I thought the cooking class was a "mid" 2/5 because the instructions were mostly in Italian and weren't very clear. The chef would have us make dough but didn't really explain how to incorporate the egg with flour, so the egg spilled everywhere. They kept telling us to roll and flatten out the dough, but with no real standardized way to do it, no pasta maker provided like in other cooking classes, so everyone made varying thickness of pasta (and their QC was not good enough to detect major differences, because it's unlikely the chefs use rolling pins manually to roll out pasta). Each table is taught a completely different technique.

But while Serena and I thought it was mid, other guests seemed to like it and thought it was fun.

Anyway, we eat our own cooking at around 6:30PM and it was terrible--the raviolis we made had dough that was way too thick and so it was quite gross.

The great thing about Serena is her foresight--she already calculated the possibility that we would hate the food we made and so she ordered a light dinner buffet anyways as backup. As a result, we were all able to eat until we were stuffed still.

After dinner, we took rounds saying our "byes" to guests. And both of our throats started to hurt.

## Part 3: Mini-Family Trip

We headed out to the Cinque Terre area together with Serena's family as one big group (16) people!

### April 21: Sick

Woke up feeling extremely tired with a pounding headache. We then got picked up by Serena's uncle who drove me to the next hotel we will stay at. Serena went with her aunts on a minibus, and there was another minibus to store everyone's (16 people's) luggage.

After around 90 minutes, we took a break at a cafe. We resumed our mini-road trip and another 90 minutes later arrived to [Capitolo Riviera](https://capitoloriviera.com/it/).

The place is pretty great. It's literally brand new, as one of Serena's aunt/uncle apparently can stay at *new* hotels, which is a pretty demanding requirement. This is a 5-star hotel with turndown service. 5/5. The food is excellent as well. I didn't have an appetite at the cafe due to cold chills but the food here was so good that it gave me an appetite again.

Anyways, it's good that the hotel had early check-in for all of us because we just slept right after lunch, and mostly didn't wake up other than to shower, take medicine, and eat some protein bars.

### April 22: Strep Throat?

Serena's aunt gave us some medicine the night before and it seemed to work well. Fever and headache completely gone. But my throat felt worse and it burns when I swallow food.

Anyways, being almost all better we went around Cinque Terre and did a cool cliff hike after a boat ride. After the hike was done, we went to town to eat a little bit. Then, we did a quick, 15 minute hike to look at some cliffs and sea, and then took a train ride to a fancy restaurant. We had:

* Scallops - 5/5, cooked perfectly with a nice, delicate and cheesy sauce.
* Small squid pasta - 5/5 - nicely al dente and the small squid was juicy.
* Catch of the day - 4/5 mostly because of price, but the potatos + soft fish was done fairly decently. Not too exciting though.
* Stockfish stew - 4/5 - fish + potatoes in stew style = good.
* Fish ravioli - 5/5 - they had a little sweet sauce on the ravioli which made the savory contrast really interesting.
* Apple tart - 5/5 - really excellent texture juxtapose between the soft apple tart cream and sponge-like cake, and the harder bottom kind of like a slightly softer Graham cracker.

After dinner, we headed back to the hotel and I did a bunch of resesarch on symptoms of:

* Sudden fever
* Sore throat with rashes
* No cough
* No runny nose

Strep? Will take a 'wait and see' approach to see if throat gets even more painful, if so will need to go through the annoying process of trying to get antibiotics prescription from Italian telehealth.

## Part 4: Honeymoon

When I think of honeymoon, I think of long vacations that are extra-special because you just got married. But for me it is hard to create that classification because Serena and I have been fortunate enough already to do month-long trips already in the past and we've already experienced many, very extra-special experiences. Though we of course try to enjoy the best of our vacation regardless.

### April 23: "Get on the boat" / Portofino 1

We checked out of Capitolo Riviera in the morning after having one final breakfast with Serena's family. We took off at around 12:15PM and arrived at [Villa Gelsomino Exclusive House](https://www.tripadvisor.it/ShowUserReviews-g187827-d21280031-r965416713-Villa_Gelsomino_Exclusive_House-Santa_Margherita_Ligure_Italian_Riviera_Liguria.html) 1PM.

Luckily, we get early check-in!

This isn't a 5-start hotel but the room is quite cute, with an intricately painted ceiling I stared at for a while because it looked interesting. It had various fruits on the 4 different sides of the ceiling, and the center of the ceiling is painted as a sunroof, with vines growing on the sunroof window frame.

The view is incredible, looking out into the village of Santa Margherita Ligure, and the nearby docks/Ligurian Sea.

Ever since we landed, most days has been cloudy. Except this one. The next day was supposed to be a bit cloudy as well, so Serena had the idea to book a private boat tour. This was at about 2:30PM. We scrambled looking for one, and Serena finally found one. By 3:30PM we were on the docks, meeting with the skipper. By 3:45PM we set off to sea.

He showed us everything from:

* A villa that Moussolini used to own, and now is owned by Louis Vuitton.
* A villa that Dolce Gabanna sold to Bill Gates, that he wants to turn into an expensive hotel.
* Various WW2 bunkers.
* More Louis Vuitton Villas.
* Superyachts owned by the Pirelli family (they make tires).
* A speed yacht owned by the guys that made Haribo.
* Various villas owned by people connected with the government. The iconic Louis Vuitton Villa is right next to the villa owned by the riches family in Italy as you enter Portofino by boat. Other words, these neighbors are: the richest family in Italy and the richest family in the world.
* A big villa under construction (right next to Bill Gate's) that's owned by a Russian oligarch. But has since been confiscated until the war ends.
* An iconic D&G castle, where the other Khardasian got married and apparently they also sponsored her dress.
* Stopped by Portofino. This is a small town with overpriced food but mostly is convenient for luxury shopping because Loro, Louis Vuitton, and all other LVMH brands. **For me, the best part is getting on a private boat without having to wait in a long line for a public ferry while all others watched in envy.** After all, why do things if not for the envy of others?
* Stopped by another place that can't really be gotten to be car, only via walking from Portofino for about  an hour and a half, or another nearby town for about 4 hours. It has a big mausoleum and a watch tower, as well as a monastery now-repurposed as restaurants/tourist services.

All in all, it was a really cool and wonderful experience and we headed back.

On the way back, the skipper took a 90-degree turn and just said "Dolphins!" And there were a bunch of dolphins swimming. We caught a few glimpses of a bunch of dolphins swimming around before we headed back.

After we dropped off our stuff at Villa Gelsomino, we headed out to eat. We ordered 5 pastas:

1. Appetizer is codfish with pea cream. 5/5 because the codfish is really soft and fluffy, like a potato. It's almost like they bashed it many times until it became very easy to bite into and fluffy, and reshaped it back into cod-shape.
2. Trofie with half cooked, half raw asparagus. 5/5. My mouth is filled with blisters, so this was one of the few things that can go down smoothly. We ordered this twice.
3. Red prawn spaghetti with tomato. 5/5. Prawn is carpaccio style.
4. Frutti di mare pasta - 3/5 - I don't remember much about this one.
5. Orechietta with guanciale - 5/5. Though it burned my tongue heavily because of the intense salt in the guanciale is literally like salt in my wounds (of which my entire mouth was).

All in all, 5/5 everything tasted really good and I'm sure even the pasta I don't remember tasted great. They put a lot of thought into the execution of every dish which is delightful.

We also went through 3.5 bottles of water because every bite hurt my mouth.

The damage for the 6 plates plus 3.5 bottles of water was about 120 euros.

My hands also started getting painful blisters, so the diagnosis is changed from steph to Hand-Foot-And-Mouth disease. This is much more manageable as it is simply viral and will go away in a week without complications.

But painful.

### April 24: Portofino 2

With great pain in my mouth, we ate breakfast at the villa. After, we set sail at around 12:15PM to Portofino.

We walked around a bit and then ate a fancy lunch at around 95 euro per person (3 course). Actually not too bad because the individual items I describe below would have cost much more per person:

1. Amuse Bouche - A small bread bite with avocado on the bottom and shrimp on the top. But these are hard to go wrong, so 5/5.
2. First course: Tuna spaghetti. Tuna made into strands and then twirled together, like a forkful of spaghetti. Dressed generously with a seafood-tasting cream. 5/5, very unique and delicious.
3. Second course: Stuffed very large rigatoni with tomato sauce. They give us giant cotton bibs so we won't splash ourselves with the tomato sauce. This is very thoughtful and nothing I've ever seen before. Tomato is acidic and burned my mouth a lot but well worth it. 5/5
4. Third course: Tiramisu. Nice and creamy. Sweet, but not too sweet. 5/5.

On the sides were various breads. I really liked the poppy-seed heavy bread even though it sliced my mouth (bread is hard). And their focaccia is the best I've ever had. This region invented focaccia and it shows.

Whole experience = 5/5.

We then went shopping. I stopped by Loro but didn't buy anything. While their jackets are cool they are not as functional for me:

* Their windmate bomber is reversable and waterproof and cashmere, which is cool. Except there's no hood so you still get soaked from your head if it rains.
* Their traveler has many pockets and seems to be made for traveling. This sounds cool and functional but there are no zip pockets, so securing items is not so secure after all. Also, while there is a hood, it is a bit flimsy and small, and not very practical for rain.

I don't mind getting a traveler-like jacket if they made it with better pockets and a sturdier hood with perhaps and extended hood, so water won't splash your eyes when it rains.

We did get some water from them though.

Next, we hit up BV and Serena got something. We also got water from them and they had really nice service. They locked the door so other customers couldn't get in while we were shopping, making it a very private shopping experience.

Or they locked us in so we couldn't leave without paying.

What is surprising to me is Portofino is a very wealthy city and there were many people walking around, but not many walked into luxury stores to buy stuff.

Another thing is that the night before, they did a celebration where they burned a bunch of trees to celebrate the saint that protects Portofino island (our tour guide pointed this out yesterday in the private boat tour as we were going ashore Portofino). So on this day, the huge mountain of trees we saw yesterday is now a bunch of hot, fuming ashes.

After some more walking around, we took the ferry home at 5PM.

5:30PM we ate at a pretty nicely priced restaurant. Pastas were in the teens which is very reasonable. We had:

* A big seafood soup, which was good (3.5/5) but hurt my mouth due to bones scraping against my blistered tongue.
* Spaghetti vongole - 5/5 - very generous with the clams and unlike the tart pomodoro sauce in the other spaghetti, this one didn't burn my mouth.
* Spaghetti frutti di mare - 5/5 - hard to critique good seafood with pasta that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

Walked around a little bit more in golden hour lighting and went back up to the villa and rested.

### April 25: Wow. Sanremo 1

Had breakfast at the villa. Enjoyed the beautiful view one last morning and set off at 11AM to a new town!

Drove around 2 hours and 40 minutes to Sanremo to beautiful [Royal Sanremo](https://www.royalhotelsanremo.com/?utm_source=gbp&utm_medium=organic). A true 5-star hotel. When I drove up the front door, 2 doorman opened both Serena and my door simultaneous, as if to pull us out of a car like kidnappings you see in the movie.

But instead, they helped take our luggages and park my car.

The downstairs of the hotel is beautiful. Wood floors with marbel columns, old money vibes. We had early check-in since + free upgrade since we booked with Amex plat. We dropped off our stuff in our immense hotel room with TWO FULL bathrooms (this is a first). I had a nepresso while waiting for luggage to come.

Once the luggage came, we went down to the pool area of the hotel, which overlooks the Ligurian Sea. We just beach-bummed there and had a 33-euro burger with fries (4.5/5--fries were crisped really well and the burger was really nicely seasoned, the beef is locally sourced). Kind of small for the price, but we get a $100 credit from Amex Plat so that's generally how it works (food is overpriced but you still get a lot of it for free, so it takes a lot of the sting out of buying food in the hotel).

In our case, we weren't locked into hotel food as there were many affordable restaurants nearby despite the Monaco vibes.

I swam in their pool twice in the course of our 4-hour beach-bumming session. It was quite nice because it cools you off and there's a little nook where there is a large water column with moderate pressure that helps massage your back and any other joints you want to align to the column.

Even their public shower area has a separate makeup room...with a chair and a BLOWDRYER.

All in all it is a really awesome beach resort experience unlike any other. They made showering and drying off really convenient.

Their beach chairs also come with a little solid/adjustable umbrella so if you want to take a nap you won't get sunburned.

The whole thing is just so well thought out that while I don't rate resort beach experiences, it is a 6/5.

The weather was also killer with the beaming sun that made the ocean gleam and the waterfront look lively.

After beach bumming we decided to checkout their free spa before dinner. They have infinite juice/water to drink. There's a big jacuzzi pool where each section has their own different set of jets. There's also an 'emotional' shower where they randomly spray scents and spray you with different temperature water.

Emotional damage.

We also did the steam room which is quite nice. The sauna is only at 60C which is quite cool for a sauna and not very intense at all and was kind of boring.

After a quick shower and change of clothes, we did dinner at 7PM with a deadline to GTFO by 8:30PM. We had:

* A "small" seafood platter even though there were like a couple dozen pieces of seafood. From various types of clams to 2 small scarlett shrimps to 2 regular juicy shrimps. And 4 oysters. 5/5 - really insanely great deal for the value to be honest. I was shocked when they brought it out and was like "wtf this is piccolo? My Italian's not that bad."
* 2 seafood risottos - 4.5/5 - again, extremely generous and tasty. Further enhanced by the fact that my tongue does not hurt as much as the day before. Risotto could be more al dente but overall really good.
* Spaghetti alla carbonara - 5/5 - guanciale is yummy and chopped up into little pieces. The carbonara is extremely generous and is probably 2.5X the portion of a regular plate at any other traditional Trattoria's primi patti.

We went back to the hotel and I type this up now in the hotel lobby as we listen to live music where they play various songs, from Michael Jackson to "Get Lucky" by Daft Punk.

## Lessons Learned

* When we got on the boat on April 23rd, that was completely spontaneous. And on April 24th, it was a bit cloudier and windier. It would have not been great to get on the boat the next day. It goes to show that **if an opportunity arises, you must always be ready and capitalize on it immediately.**
