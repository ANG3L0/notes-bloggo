# 2025 The Marriage Trip

## Overview

This is a 4 week trip. Primary purpose is to get married / have a travel destination wedding in Italy.

April 13 to May 12 2025, inclusive.

## Part 1: Florence

### April 13 - 14

We flew Emirates business class in JFK -> MXP.

Food in lounge is quite delicious and Emirates business class lounge is quite spacious. They had everything from checken legs to (small) lamb chops, to desserts of various kinds.

5-6 plates of small food later, we boarded our Emirates business class. This A380 is nice and I spent most of it not sleeping. The lounge was cool but unlike the A380 I flew SFO->DXB, there's no desk setup that makes it feel like a private jet.

The food on the plane was very good, from Chilean Sea Bass to Osso Bucco. Med meats are always kind of Mid Meats, because they are kind of dry. But overall, delicious. For booze, I just had an espresso martini and a Glenmorangie.

A movie and a nap later, we had breakfast. It as a lobster omelette with croissants, breads, and coffee. Good, 3.5/5, wished they had more lobster in the omelette though.

Getting through customs was fast. And by the time we got to luggage claim, all 3 of our luggages were there. I've never retrieved my luggage this quickly. After we speedrun the luggage claim, which took all of 10-20 seconds, we went to our restroom and met our private driver who drove us 4 hours from MXP to Firenze.

We met up with Serena's friends for dinner and ate a lot.

Better than I've eaten in a long time. And it's been a very long time since I've had good, authentic Italian food. From linguini pasta with an amazing sauce to well-balanced, heavy Italian dumplings, to mushroom pasta, to a mountain of Tiramisu, it was all really good.

What's even better is the service: they gave us a bunch of free food on the side, and on top of that they had this really amazing spicy sauce you can slobber all over your food.

On the way to the restaurant, we took the bus but on the way back, there were no more busses so we walked in the rain for about 30 minutes to get back to the hotel.

### April 15

Couldn't really sleep due to jetlag. Slept from maybe 5AM to 9:30AM.

Went out to meet Serena's friends to eat lunch at a place called Trattoria Sergio Gozzi. It was really good. We had:

* Beef stew - 2/5 too salty but sauce was good.
* Pork chop - 3/5 average.
* Pastas - 3/5 average. Not al dente enough.
* Liver - 6/5 so juicy, so moist. Just like fois gras.
* House wine - 4/5, more sour than full-bodied. Very nice to cut through the gamey liver and meats.
* Overall: 4/5, the liver + wine really slaps.

I ended up eating the most as usual. Even more than the pregnant woman at the table. Did everyone else eat anorexic amounts, or do I eat too much?

Walked around and took some photos outside the Duomo. We also did some afternoon espresso, which was followed by a quick Merry Go Around stop at the city center.

We walked around a little bit more and then did afternoon tea/coffee in the city center, next to the Merry Go Around. Half of Serena's friends went back home to sleep, another stayed with us to walk around a bit more, including a trip to [Cantina del Gelato, which we always visit in Florence](../italy_2023).

At around 7PM, we made our way to a restaurant inside Hotel Hermitage. Famous for truffles, maybe? Had:

* Pasta with regular truffle - 1/5, was like pasta boiled in water only. No taste.
* Pasta with winter truffle - 3/5, had some truffle flavor but still bland.
* Osso buco - 4/5 - Good flavor, falls apart nicely.
* Chicken breast with lemon sauce - 4/5 - I really liked the lemon sauce as it was nice and tart, which is nice to eat with meats. The chicken breast itself was moist which is hard to do.
* Chicken breast with truffle - 4/5 - Also moist chicken breast and the truffle adds a little bit to the sauce.
* Beef tartare - 5/5. It also had truffle that I can barely taste but beef tartare always tastes good.
* Slices of beef - 3.5/5. These are like thin slices of raw steak which is nice, and showered with truffle. But the truffle had zero taste compared to the beef tartare.
* Fettucine ragu - 4/5 - Ragu nicely flavored, nice contrast to bland AF truffle dishes.
* Overall - 3/5. Slow-ish service and quite expensive for what it was.

Then we went to Cantina del Gelato again. Their gelato is nice, creamy, and smooth unlike many other places that are maybe too dense, too sweet, or just lacks a je nais se quois.

Walked back home (no rain today, yay) for about 30 mins.
