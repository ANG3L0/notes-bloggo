# Asia 2023

## Itinerary

Going to Hanoi for a week.

Then Hong Kong. For ~3 weeks.

Then Japan. For ~2 weeks.

## Hanoi

### Nov 14 - 16: Departure

Local time: 4:30PM.

Went to JFK airport. First time using Amex lounge. They've got a very limited food selection, but it was good quality. Mostly enjoyed their truffle soup and pasta.

Oh yeah, and they have bottomless free drinks at their speakeasy, 1850.

![amex lounge speakeasy](../images/jfk_amex_1850.jpg)

Flight left around 10:20PM.

The flight from JFK-SIN is the longest flight in the world:

> Currently, the world's longest flight is the **9,585-mile route between New York City and Singapore**, operated by Singapore Airlines with a flying time of 18.5 hours.

It took us about 18 hours to get to Singapore. But we weren't done.

We had 4 hours before we'd need to transit to Hanoi. So, the first thing we did when we landed in Singapore was buy Kaya toast.

![amex lounge speakeasy](../images/kaya_toast.jpg)

Then we went to the KrisFlyer Gold Lounge. This is similar to HKG's Singapore Business Class lounge. They had draft beer and a bunch of free, hot food. The best was their laksa.

Anyway, adding up the entire journey:

* 6-hour wait at JFK.
* 18 hour flight.
* 4 hour wait in SIN.
* 2.5 hour flight to Hanoi.
* 45 minutes to get our luggage.
* 40 minutes to our hotel.

**The journey took about 32 hours to complete.**

Once we checked in our hotel, we immediately taxi'd to one of the pho places we added when were first planning our trip. Had spring rolls (both fresh and fried), pho, and papaya salad.

![amex lounge speakeasy](../images/pho_hanoi_1.jpg)

After that, we walked around town and had some egg coffee. What is egg coffee? Basically, as a French colony, Hanoi was too poor to afford milk. So instead of cappucino, they'd foam up milk and mix it in with coffee instead. The foam tastes like foamy egg yolk mixed with condensed milk--very yolky, yet sweet and embracing.
![amex lounge speakeasy](../images/egg_coffee.jpg)

Walking around, we also got some Banh Mi. Very good.

Around 4PM, we went to a tailor shop. The main mission is to get some dresses for Serena. And I was looking to get some shirts and pants as well. We went to Royal Silk.

Royal Silk's unique because they shop materials with you. We went to a local bazaar and she showed us around, and let us pick the specific fabric + color combo we want for our clothes. This is a big deal because instead of forcing us to pay a certain amount, we had full authority of our budget. If we chose something very expensive, the material cost is just passed back to us.

Afterwards, the tailor treated us to dinner. She was very nice.

One thing we learned from her during dinner is that she actual gets a lot of word of mouth customers, and does a lot of wholesaling on the side.

Exhausted after dinner, we went back home and slept.

### **Nov 17: Hanoi is fucking crazy**

#### Breakfast (Michelin)

Woke up at 3AM because I couldn't sleep and did some work.

At around 8AM, we went to get breakfast. We saw the menu but didn't know what it said. So I whipped out google translate. Only to be not be able to input the accented letters.

The lady next to us started chatting us up and recommending things on the menu.

She also recommended a few of her favorite places as a local (her father's from Hanoi). She lives in the middle of the country but would visit Hanoi for business as part of her work for 3M.

One thing we noticed is that the people here in general is very nice and friendly. It's not like the US.

#### Walking around town / lunch

And then we had a massage. My first time doing cupping. Cupping is basically they have these cups that generate a vacuum with hot air.

What results is supposed to be detoxification. I'm not sure about that, but what I am sure of is the process is equivalent to getting a lot of giant hickeys on your back:

![cupping results](../images/1guy1cup.jpg)

Then we had lunch. Food here is interesting because it's someone's house. The bathroom is their bathroom. Had bun cha, and it was fun because the owner shows you how to eat all the condiments together, and feeds you. Then, we had spring rolls and duck.

Afterwards, there's a presentation on how they make a sauce. They basically present to us some salt and peppers in a bowl. And then they would squeeze a shit ton of fresh lime juice in front of us into the bowl.

Once that was done, they brought out a fried tofu dish, along with a bunch of vegetables, and a spinach soup thing.

We ate most of everything and was extremely full.

Then came the entertainment.

Someone next to us came in and she had a horrified look on her face when the owner showed how to eat the food. And even more horrified when it was fed to her. Then an old vietnamese lady came to demo the lime juice sauce. Once she was done squeezing half a dozen lime's juice into a bowl, the girl diner asked:

> To drink?

As the waitress is an old viet lady, she has no idea what the fuck the diner was talking about. So the old viet lady just smiled and walked away. The diner proceeded to drink the lime juice *like it was a fucking soup.* I almost burst out laughing.

We left and walked a bunch around town. Maybe 6000-7000 steps, mostly along a promenade. Visited Uniqlo as I was curious about pricing. The lime juice drinker was there. Pricing's about the same as New York's location. Which is very expensive, especially for Vietnamese standards. For comparison, it's about $16 for a Uniqlo T-shirt (NY is about $19).

Went home for a bit, and then went back out as there's preliminary fitting for Serena's dresses. Afterwards, we ate at a pho place where they serve chicken ovaries.

The ovaries tastes like ovos moles except not sweet. Just pure good yolkiness.

After dinner, I walked home. And traffic here is **insane.** No rules whatsoever. Just cars and mopeds just zooming by. Inches from you. Pure chaos. In the 15 minute walk back home I got hit twice by mopeds.

At home, I'm writing this entry and am absolutely exhausted.

### Nov 18: 2 spa treatments in 1 day

#### Banh Mi

We ate banh mi for breakfast. The thing I love about Vietnam is that they give you condiments almost any restaurant you go. In this case, there's homemade chili sauce.

It was good for me but too spicy for Serena.

For drinks we had:

* Coffee + condensed milk, as recommended by the 3M lady from yesterday
* Some delicious tea

#### My first facial

At 10AM, we went to a facial appointment.

They took pictures of my face with infrared and other wavelengths, and analyzed it.

TLDR my face was fucked up. Age 41.

For about 2 hours, they put a lot of cream on my face and then washed it off. They also scrubbed blackheads out and did what they call "aqua peeling." I have no idea which part was the aqua, and which part was the peeling, but they also used a bunch of machines to treat my face:

1. They first steamed my face for like 15 minutes.
2. Once they removed blackheads, they blasted my face with what seemed to be very cold water, or liquid nitrogen (felt like cyro).
3. Then they did some rolly-scrub thing where the thing they used to scrub my face was super cold.

They analyzed my face after the treatment again. Age 38.

Still fucked. They told me to use sunscreen and lots of repair cream.

Shocked by how fucked up my face was, they had me go into the treatment room again and slapped some SPF 50 on my face.

#### Walked around some more

We had more tea, egg coffee, and snacks around town.

For lunch, we had bun cha in a crowded hallway. It was really good, because the pork meat they grilled were super juicy. The fish sauce was great, yet not overpowering. And we had soy milk. Here's a video of an old lady grilling the meat, fresh:

<video controls  style="height:480px;">
  <source src="../images/bun_cha.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

but we were trying to save our appetite for dinner since we booked a Michelin restaurant.

#### 2nd spa treatment of the day

In the afternoon, we booked a foot massage. It was interesting. I thought it'd just be a 90-minute foot massage but they actually massaged the entire leg area, along with my arms. They also scraped dead skin off with a foot file.

At then end of the treatment, they also did something called [parafin treatment](https://www.healthline.com/health/paraffin-wax). Basically they melted wax (hot), and applied it to your feet. Once your feet has turned into what looks like foot-candles, they wrap them in a plastic bag for ~10 minutes.

After the 10 minutes, they remove the wax layer from your feet like socks.

90-minutes, for 2 people, totaled only $40. So $20 per person.

#### +1 Michelin Star

Ate at a 1-star Michelin called Gia Restaurant for dinner. About $250 for 2.

Delicious. Everything's what you'd expect from a Michelin starred restaurant. A mix of luxurious and local ingredients ranging from monkfish liver to wagyu beef. If you've eaten at high-end restaurants, then you know exactly roughly the vibe and the quality of food.

But what stands out to me was the juice pairing. Most restaurants try to rip you off with alcohol pairings; it's rare to have something with juice pairings. I prefer the latter as they don't fuck up my taste buds for the course of the meal, and won't ruin the meal by making me too inebriated to be fully present with my taste buds. Here's the juices they made:

1. Kombucha fermented with pear and camomile (tasted like honey)
2. Tomato consumme with guava
3. Hibiscus and shiso leaf kombucha (tasted like cranberries and aftertaste smelled like lavender)
4. Passionfruit juice added to fermented rice (had a grainy texture, like beans, and tasted like guava)

After the meal, they had us go downstairs and pick 3 fruits for our dessert course. They made mini-sorbets from the 3 fruits we picked.

There's also 2 other desserts after that:

* A mix of lotus ice cream, and a bunch of other delicious fruit done in a very dessert texture
* Some biscuits / candies.

Here's an example video of the staff explaining one of the dishes as is typical of any fine dine restaurant:

### Nov 19: FULL DAY OF EATING

It's weekend today so I didn't have to work. This means I can just explore and eat the whole day.

#### Breakfast

For breakfast, we went to a closeby pho place. It was really good. Only 80K (or about $3.30). **This is for 2 people.**

After, we walked to a place called Banh Me Mama. She was very slow. Took about 30 minutes to serve 3 people ahead of us. But this place receives high ratings and people say it is worth waiting 2 hours for.

It was good because she makes everything fresh: the eggs are freshly fried and the bread is freshly baked. The meat is mostly freshly cooked. All this "freshness" contributes to slowness.

Again--this was good, better than the average Banh Mi, but not world-changing: I wouldn't go again due to the wait.

#### Snacks 1 & 2

Then we stopped by a coffee shop to have some coffee. We ordered a "silver" coffee which is basically iced black coffee with condensed milk on the bottom. You can scoop up and mix as much condensed milk as you want to adjust the sweetness. Also ordered a hot black coffee with milk; this was less sweet than the iced version, giving it the perfect balance.

Done with that, we wanted to walk around. But right next door was a coffee shop that served egg coffee, so we went there first. 55K dong for 1 yolk and 75K dong for 2 yolks. The coffee is cold coffee, so the egg yolk curdles at the top. Sounds gross, but I like it since you can scoop it up and eat it easier. You can also mix the egg yolk with the coffee to give the coffee a smoother flavor.

#### Walking around + more eating

We then walked around and found that the roads were closed. There was a Japanese festival going on and kids were dressed up in Demon Slayer costumes, performing songs on stage.

Throughout the area, there's tons of stores that sell fakes. Fake Moncler, Nikes--any clothing brand you can think of, they have it. The quality is suspect.

Except for 4 fake Nike shirts I bought for $16 total (4 per shirt). They were very stretchy and are dry-fit. This was put to the test later with great success.

Saw a high-end mall where they had Rolex stores and the like. We went in the mall, walked around a bit, and then went to the Rolex store where they don't have anything in stock, per usual.

Many steps later, we were thirsty and drank a fresh coconut (30K) + sugar cane juice (20K).

At the time of this writing, you can estimate cost by thinking about 25K Vietnamese Dong (vnd) as $1 USD.

After *that*, we saw an old lady selling roast pork on a kebab. We bought 2 sticks and it was **only 30K**. She reheated them fresh with a friend's coal stove. It was juicy and the meat had just enough fat in it to make it very succulent. At the same time, the outside had a nice charcoal flavor to it.

#### Lunchtime

We then went to some noodle place as recommended by Mark Wiens. Their specialty is fish with greens. And instead of regular white pho, the noodles were brown. It was very good, and dirty and ghetto.

2 bowls of noodles and 2 plates of fried fish later = 170K.

#### Drinks

After lunch, we got some drinks at a place called Hanoi House. We got:

* A passionfruit tea--a little too sweet, for about 50K
* Coconut coffee, for about 75K. This was good.
* A cocktail (overrated), for 250K. This was expensive for what it was, in the context of Vietnam.

#### Taking a break from eating

We walked home afterwards and showered and napped for a bit. This was because we still had jetlag and had a 4:00PM appointment to do private Pilates.

#### Exercise (finally)

4-5PM was Pilates. I thought this would be mostly flexibility and torture, as I am not flexible.

But this wasn't about flexibility; it was more about controlled strength. So a lot of slow reps in bodybuilding comes into play.

A lot of abdominal holds and muscle control, combined with deep inhales and exhales where you need to focus on expanding and contracting your ribs--while simultaneously "using your pelvic floor to lift up your shoulders," whatever that means. But there's a lot of interesting cues and body-control instructions that definitely challenged my mobility skills, even after many years of lifting and exercise.

Off top of my head, the moves we learned really translated to:

* Squats
* Calf raises
* Ab holds / boat pose
* Lat pulldowns
* Chest flyes
* Side ab raises

Some can't really be translated and are fairly mobility / Pilates specific.

Mild exercise for an hour really worked up an appetite, so let's eat some more.

#### Dinner + Dessert

For dinner, we took Grab to a place called Pho bung Hang Trong. It's basically this old lady's home, and we went up to her bedroom (you can tell because her bed's next to the window, and the rest of the bedroom is repurposed into a dining area for guests--it was about maybe 150 sqft).

Really great pho. Had fried bread to dip it into the broth as well.

80K VND only.

Then, still hungry, we went to a closeby dessert place. We then proceeded to eat 2 cheesecakes, 1 loaf of bread with coconut butter filling, and another fresh coconut.

Then we went home.

#### Summarized list

To count how much I ate from my POV, here's a recap of the day (highly inaccurate calorie estimate in parenthesis):

1. Pho (350)
2. Banh mi (400)
3. 2 coffees (300)
4. Half a fresh coconut, half a cup of sugarcane juice (150)
5. Pork skewer (100)
6. Bowl of fish pho + fish spring rolls (700)
7. Half passionfruit tea, half coconut coffee, half cocktail (550)
8. Pho with fried bread (550)
9. 1 cheesecake + half loaf of bread with coco butter filling + fresh coco (600)

Very roughly 3700 cals. OK I'm done.

### Nov 20: Fun Outing

At 6:30AM, a private car was here to pick us up. The car's pretty new and had a new car smell. Drove us 2+ hours to meet up with our guide.

Then, we climbed the 2 viewpoints in Mua Caves. One's about 500 steps and has a dragon at the top, with jaggedy rocks. The other is an Insta-worthy pole--kind of like how the top of Misson Peak looks like.

The climb's not too bad; what was gross is that the park operators were burning plastic trash, so the climb up was really gross / carcinogenic.

Quick fun fact about "Mua Caves"--it is supposed to be accented, but the sign is not. Non-accented has a very different meaning:

* Mua = buy
* Caves = prostitutes

Accented, it means "cave of dance (mua)" instead.

After we climbed the mountain, we had a fresh coconut + coffee with condensed milk.

Walked around a bit in these large lotus fields. And our tour guide did not give a *fuck.* He just straight up ripped the lotus from the pond and showed us that if you rip apart the stems, you can spin the fibers into silk. He also found a lotus root that he ripped out and showed us that the seeds inside are edible. It was crunchy, like a radish would be, but inside the seed is gooey. Yum. My first time trying this ingredient.

I love trying out new food ingredients because having eaten a lot of food for 30+ years on Earth, it is such a rare opportunity to try out something I've never eaten before.

We were then driven to take a boat ride around the famed Tam Coc, where the lady in the back rows the boat *with her feet.* Check it out (ROFL at the rowing lady's face)

<video controls  style="height:720px;">
  <source src="../images/viet_boat.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

90 minutes of this later, we went back to our car and visited a large Pagoda. Buddhism is quite interesting and has a lot of mythology around it that has a lot of modern-day references. I learned today that:

* The tiles represents the scales of goldfish, and it is lore that goldfish turns into dragons. And the dragons help protect the temple from fire (since they are water-based). **Wait, but this is just Magikarp -> Gyarados!**
* When Buddha was born, he had 1 finger pointed to the sky and 1 pointed to hell. And he uttered: "Throughout heaven and earth, I alone am the honored one." **But wait, this is just what Gojo said during his fight with Toji!**

Then, our tour guide brought us to the outside of the pagoda where he showed us some exploding plants. These plants, when it rains, crack open violently, and spray their seeds everywhere, as a way to pollinate. Here's a science-fair demo:

<video controls  style="height:720px;">
  <source src="../images/firecrack_plants.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag.
</video>

It was around 2PM then and we were driven home. Each trip was about a 2-hour drive, and the total cost was about $200.

#### Haircut cost

We dropped our stuff off and I got a haircut + hair massage / hair wash. It was supposed to cost $9 (haircut) + $9 (for washing hair + massage). But because I had so little hair and they finished everything within 20 minutes, they only charged me $9. They charged Serena $9 even though she only opted in for the hair wash, because they ended up taking 40 minutes to:

* Wash her hair
* Massage her head
* Massage her back
* Massage her face

So even though I also cut my hair, I ended up being the one waiting.

#### Dinner + Dessert

For dinner, we ate 2 meals.

First, was the pho we had on [Nov 17](#breakfast-michelin). Right after we ate a bowl of pho, we immediately headed to Cha Ca Thang Long--another Mark Wiens place where they do fish + thick green vegetables. The Google images don't look that amazing but eating there was. The way the fish is freshly cooked in oil, and how it juxtaposes the bun cha (dry rice noodles), fish sauce, cilantro, nuts, and other greens--when it is all mixed together, the texture and the taste profile is nothing short of magical.

![Who knew fish + veg would be so delish?](../images/fish_veg.jpg)


Also good about the 2nd restaurants is that it is a set meal so you don't have a choice and don't have to choose. You just choose drinks, of which we had 2 Vietnamese tea. About $16 for dinner which is kind of expensive, but keep in mind there was a lot of condiments / veggies they give to you on the side.

After our 2 dinners, we had some desserts. We had 2 lotus-based dessert, and another dessert where they were 2 mochi balls: one with coconut and one with sesame, along with a strong, sweet soup base kind of like the base of "tong yuen" in Cantonese dessert. It was nice because unlike Western desserts where it is just diabetes on a plate, the dessert here had only natural sweetness and was very mild.

![Viet dessert](../images/vietnam_dessert.jpg)

Went home after.

### Nov 21: A lot more eating (and shopping)

This is our last full day in Hanoi, and there's nothing to do here other than eat. So we ate. Chronologically:

* [Breakfast] egg coffee, 40K.
* [Breakfast at another place] tomato pho, 40K.
* [Breakfast 3] went to another place to get milk coffee, 40K.
* [Brunch] walked to a Bun Cha place we ate in one of the earlier days and had a Bun Cha + spring rolls = 55K.

![bun cha](../images/bun_ca.jpg)

* [Lunch] walked to a closeby Banh Mi place. Ate a banh mi for 25K.

Getting full, we took a shopping break. Serena and I bought 9 pieces of clothing (5 cotton, zippered shorts for me, and 2 long sleeves + 2 leggings for Serena). All for only $76 USD (about 1.9 million VND).

Tired from all the shopping, we continued our calorie onslaught:

* [Lunch 2] we went to the same exact coffee place at [breakfast 3] and ordered some other drinks. Had banana coffee (which turned out to be basically a banana smoothie mixed with coffee + 2 slices of dehydrated bananas--very good), and also egg cocoa (like egg coffee, except instead of whipped egg mixed with bitter coffee, it was mixed with sweet cocoa--very good also). Cost 80K.
* [Lunch 3] We then walked around and had sugarcane juice for 20K.

We then did more shopping, where Serena got some earrings and I got some prints that you can iron on clothes. They're printed but look like they're embroidered so when you glue it on clothes, it'll look like it's embroidered. I plan to iron these onto white hoodies / shirts. I got:

* 2 different designs for NASA (50K)
* 2 sesame streets (30K)

Or about $3 and change.

Then, I had a 2 hour massage where they used hot stones. And Serena got a 2.5 hour massage. The total for both of us cost the same as the 9 pieces of clothing (about $76 USD). After the massage, it was about 5PM and we picked up our tailor-fitted clothes.

To my disappointment, I had ordered suit pants that were made of flexible material, but I also explicitly requested the waist be able to be adjusted. She told me she couldn't find the band to buy, so instead of a 4cm slack at the waste, I get 0cm.

I also forgot to tell her that I want my initials embroidered on one of the shirts, so it wasn't.

All in all, it was very cheap for an OK quality tailor, but it kind of felt like a bait-and-switch due to the whole:

> Me: Can I have this waist be adjustable?
>
> Tailor: Yes, instead of side tabs I can also just add a band to the waist to give you 4cm of flex.
>
> Me: Sure
>
> Tailor (few days later): Here's the final product without what we talked about.

Despite the waist being kind of mediocore, the pants material is 4-way stretch and very good. Normally, this would be very expensive but for some reason, lots of women's pants use another 4-way stretch material and is for some reason cheaper. So we used that instead. I did squats and the pants material didn't catch at all.

To fix the waist situation, I requested 2 additional buttons to be added onto the pants so that I can button the pants in a very loose position when bulking, and a very tight position when peak cutting.

As this is our last night in Hanoi, she will drop off our clothes at around 9P-11P at our hotel.

Meanwhile, we had dinner once again at Pho bung Hang Trong. It was just as good as the last time we had it a few days ago. This was 40K.

We still had about 200K left, so we spent 195K of that on a dessert place. If this money isn't spent, it would have been wasted as VND isn't really good for much.

**All in all, we spent (per person) 340K across 7 meals ($14) not including dessert. And 440K including it ($18).**

**For shopping, I spent about 900K + 80K (or about $40) to get 5 zippered shorts and 4 pieces of decor I can iron onto clothes.**

**Finally, we spent about $76 USD for a massage. This was for both people, so it cost about $40 per person.**

## Hong Kong

### Nov 22 - 24: Continuous Eating

On November 22, we left for the airport in the morning. Normally, Priority Pass lounges are shit because they're so crowded. Hanoi airport's was great. They refilled food constantly (even if they haven't run out at all)--they had delicious pho, along with a ton of other food selections. Coffee abound, and it is one of the few Priority Pass lounges left that let you have free-flowing, free alcohol.

I had 2 phos, some other noodles, egg rolls, and a whiskey. Funny how weird my food combos are when things are free.

Had some last-minute tasks to do for work, so I did those while in the lounge.

We flew and arrived to HKG at ~1PM. **I love HKG.**

All airports we've been to has always been a 30-minute to 1-hour wait for luggage. It took maybe 20 minutes from getting off the airplane, going through customs, waiting for our luggage (which showed up almost immediately), walking to the ground transport, and then getting on the taxi.

HKG is hands-down world's best airport; some would argue it is Changi. I'd say the latter is pretty good but I've never had a better experience (not to mention the excellence is *consistent*) than HKG.

Then we ate a bunch of stuff; off the top of my head:

* Sushi place where the sushi plates are delivered to you on a plastic train / tray that automagically slides the dishes to you on a rail.
* Afuri (yuzu tsukemen).
* Egglettes at Mammy Pancake.

Then went to Apita downstairs to get some groceries. I bought a bunch of chocolate milk and coffee. Coffee pricing was *charm pricing*: $60 HKD for a pack of 16; $70 HKG for 2 packs of 16. Obviously, you buy the latter--not bad actually, about $0.30 per packet. These are drip/pourover-coffee packets where you open up the package and the package itself has latches that attach to the sides of your cup. Then all you do is pour boiling water onto the package (which is made out of paper-filter material), and you get pretty good tasting coffee with minimum effort.

![easy pourover](../images/jap_drip.jpg)

The next day (23rd), I ate / drank:

* The coffee I bought
* Coconut cream pastry / tomato-based sausage pastry from a bakery downstairs
* 8-courses at Cuisine Cuisine (a high-class Chinese restaurant). There was a 50% off coupon. It was **very** filling because each course has multiple plates (like a couple of dumplings + soup is 1 course). And Serena's mom was full so she gave me a lot of her portions for the last few plates. Some examples:
![Cuisine Cuisine fine dine](../images/cuisinecuisine_1.jpg)
![More fancy Chinese food](../images/cuisinecuisine_2.jpg)
![Even more exquisite food](../images/cuisinecuisine_3.jpg)

* Japanese pancake

* Blueberry croissant
* Oxtail
* Chicken soup / chicken



Next day (24th):

For lunch we went to a place called Ap Lei Chau. There is a famous seafood market there. How it works is you buy seafood downstairs and then go upstairs and pick a kitchen to cook it for you. We got:

* Fried squid
* Razor clams
* Geoduck (mini). On shell w/ glass noodles
* Giant shrimp (about a 1.25 feet long each). This was most expensive items
* Scallop on shell w/ glass noodles
* Milk tea + coffee as one drink (called 'yin yang' in Chinese)

At night, me and my uncle at at a Malaysian place. For only $130 HKD they gave us a starter (2 chicken wings), a big plate of food, plus a drink. Again, high volume of food and I was very satisfied. We also got beer (apple cider beer for me because I am not sophisticated). The rice was also pandan-based and had a very strong coconut scent. Was really good. Would go again. Some of the food:

![great deal on Malaysian food](../images/malaysian_taikoo.jpg)

Earlier in the day, we bought 4 x [Guilinggao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilinggao) for 100 HKD since they were running a special downstairs. Normally, it costs 160 HKD. So I ate one of them for dinner and gave one to my uncle to take home.

### Nov 25: Homecooked food

Had lunch with Serena's parents. It was a pretty fancy Chinese place. We ate high-quality dim sum. Almost all the time, Serena's parents pay for our meals. This time, I pretended to pee and paid--so I finally got one in.

![This rice looks like lasagna](../images/dimsum_yum.jpg)

Then, we walked with Serena's parents for a bit, around Tai Hang (region in Causeway Bay). There's a cultural center that talks about its history: it used to be a canal area. It was prone to flooding, so they raised the sea level of the entire region. Water used to rush in from rain, and fresh water that rushed to the canals were used by locals to do laundry.

There's also a once-a-year festival that night where they burn incense a long a giant dragon in Victoria Harbor. The guy working at the cultural center was very enthused about it. I don't mind going but had other plans for the night.

Went to Serena's friend's home. She had a Speediance machine; it's like Tonal and uses electromagnetic weight resistance (i.e. it generates a magnetic force that opposes against your pulling force but varying the current through a coil). While Serena and her friend's chatting away, I just worked out. After I worked out, I ate a post-workout meal which was just a slice of apple pie we brought to her place. Then, another one of Serena's friends came--she has a new baby and it is super cute. Super chubby face.

After chatting and playing with the baby for a while, we ate at Serena's aunt's place. Her place is huge. Maybe 800-900 sqft but only 1 bedroom. In Hong Kong, this generally means 3-bedrooms, but it was made instead to carve out a gigantic living room (enough for 10+ people to dine comfortably), and an equally gigantic master bedroom with a big closet area.

The kitchen's huge as well. Not only that, the kitchen itself has an AC so that you won't get too hot cooking food.

Serena's aunt took a bunch of cooking courses that taught them various French cooking techniques. It was like a Michelin-starred meal. We had:

* Seaweed soup + hand-made cuttlefish ball.
* Soy sauce chicken, yellow chicken.
* Fresh, roasted, suckling pig. Super juicy and fat. Brought in by Serena's other aunt/uncle.

![Baby pig](../images/roast_pig.jpg)

* Shrimp.
* Hairy crab (Chinese mitten crab). These crabs are small but very creamy. The male has a much more dense goo in its skull. The female has a much more creamy goo; tastes like very creamy egg yolk. I ate 3.
* Ginger soup.
* Various fruits: cantalope, grapes, and something called "leen mo" which is not Google-able because I don't know English for it, but it looks like a pear / apple mix. My first time having it. Here's the fruit in question:

![what fruit is this?](../images/what_fruit.jpg)

* Pistaccio basque cheesecake.

This was *all* in a *single meal.* I was stuffed after 2-3 hours of straight eating.

### Nov 26: Local food with friends and family

Went to eat with Serena's friends. Ate more local food:

* Spicy curry fishballs
* Char siu and various meats
* Egg with rice
* Cheung fun with sesame / peanut sauce / egg
* Various beef intestines
* Cucumber coffee (more bougie and less local)

After that, we went home and rested for a bit. Ate with my family at around 7PM. We had:

* Lobster with thick noodles.
* Some vegetable soup.
* Peking duck.
* Abalone with vermicelli noodles.
* Some vegetable (I think watercress?) in a broth.
* Some creamy fruit-based dessert.
* And a couple of other dishes in between I don't remember.

### Nov 27: GUESTS OF HONOR

I need to renew my Macau ID. So we wanted to stay in Macau for a day to eat. Went via boat at around 9:15AM. We ate:

* Portuguese egg tarts.
* Mixed beef intestines mixed with curry.
* Pork chop sandwich + locally famous brewed coffee.

![pork chop sandwich](../images/porkchop_sandwich.jpg)

* Goat Bakery's verison of portuguese egg tarts, which is much bigger / taller, and the inside's filled with cheese. Also had Thai green tea.
* Some noodles with beef + cold "yin yang" (see above). And toast with butter + peanut butter inside.

We originally booked St. Regis in Macau, but Serena's aunt travels for business a lot and thus had Hyatt's Globalist program. To qualify, it's like 60 nights in qualifying Hyatt hotels (think $300+/night). Anyway, as a globalist you can do what's called a "guest of honor" booking where you gift one night to someone and they get the same privileges as a Globalist:

* Late checkout
* Exclusive access to club area
* Free breakfast
* Free afternoon tea
* Free late afternoon cocktail and buffet
* Free room upgrade.

Long story short, we cancelled St. Regis because Serena's aunt graciously gifted us the Guests Of Honor. It's quite incredible. When we got back to the hotel at around 2PM after all the food above, I was completely stuffed. For the afternoon tea, I can only drink a cappucino and some water and tea.

We went up to our room and it's just HUGE. Giant living room area, with a 1 bedroom. This is nice because most hotels when I work, I'd wake Serena up; or if Serena has meetings, I'd have to stay up. Now we can work without disturbing each other's work schedule. The bathroom is also huge. There's a shower room *inside* the bathroom--it has a bathtub adjacent to a showering space, like a lot of Japanese shower rooms. This is nice because you can take a bath after, before, or *during* your shower.

The ***second room inside the bathroom*** is the toilet. And the main bathroom area is a jack and jill sink area.

After being amazed by the room, we went down to the gym. I did mostly chest, and some calves and shoulders. The gym had a machine where you can do cables, without having to adjust the height of your cables. It's hard to describe, but you can move in a very multi-dimensional way. It's very convenient to just switch from any cable-based lift you want and only switch the weights:

![interesting machine](../images/weird_gym_machine.jpg)

The annoying thing about most chest press machines is they start too far behind. This is bad for your shoulders if you go too heavy. And not a good workout if you go too light. A good workaround I learned from Sam Sulek is just to insert clips in where the machine's supposed to stop so you can force a gap. Here's what I mean:

<video controls  style="height:720px;">
  <source src="../images/chest_hack.mp4" type="video/mp4">

Here's what it looks like close-up. Macau's called City of Dreams? More like City of Snap.

![don't do this at home](../images/snapcity.jpg)

After you do this, the weight stack should be lifted a little bit already. And yes, this is super sketchy.

![pins are loaded and can fly violently](../images/sketchy_lift.jpg)

**They had a scale there and I found out that I am now +10lbs from when the trip started.** To my surprise, this is a lot less than I thought. It's OK, it's "off-season":

![powerlifter](../images/imfat.jpg)

Post-gym, we went back to the room to shower. Then, it was cocktail time. We actually didn't know there's a free buffet included in cocktail hour, but there it was. I had:

* Gin & tonic
* A martini
* Whiskey sour
* Some red wine
* 2 bowls of beef noodles, with a ton of condiments (some fried chili oil sauce, peanuts, garlic, and cilantro)
* Spring rolls
* Fatty pork meat
* Some dim sum
* Passionfruit panna cotta
* Chocolate / cherry cake

Got back to the room and showered / bathed again and started typing up Nov 25 - Nov 27, where I am now.

I forgot to mention that our living room and bedroom has a giant floor-to-ceiling window view of the adjacent Wynn Palace, which houses a giant lake with **light shows every 20 minutes.** **Each light show is different and is not the same as the other one.** Each show's about 5 minutes.

In between shows, the fountains still fire and light up, but in a predictable pattern, like a screensaver.

Having the view in our room lets us skip the Wynn Palace's cable cars, which looks at the light shows but generally has a 2 hour wait.

As I'm typing this up, I keep getting distracted by the lake's light shows, which comprises of water cannons blasting tons of water everywhere, along with red and white underwater LEDs that flash and dance around the lake rapidly. During the light shows, the Morpheus building next to us has its lights dance around as well as part of the light show. Below's a sample--doesn't really do the room justice but you can use your imagination and think about what this looks like from a hotel bedroom, where the show is different every 20 minutes.

### Nov 28: Taking care of business

Ate breakfast, and went to the Macau ID center to renew my ID. That was the whole purpose of going to Macau, after all.

The process was pretty quick. Though annoying because I went in with my ID, and need to leave Macau with my ID. Thus, my mom's friend's sister needs to pick up our Macau ID in Hong Kong, and then hand it back to my mom's friend (who lives in Macau) eventually, when my ID's ready to pick up (I'll be long gone by then).

After that, we went to the hotel gym for a bit and then took a boat back to Hong Kong. We gave it to my mom's friend's sister, and then went home.

Ate peking duck dinner with Serena and her friends.

### Nov 29: A real gym

Met with Serena's parents for lunch. Ate really good, per usual.

Then, we walked around K11 Musea for a bit. About 7K steps. Ate Dominique Ansel's Lemon Iced Tea cake. This is what it looks like smashed up (you can Google the original). It is earl grey tea filling inside and the buttom is some breaded crust:

![HK Dominique Ansel](../images/ansel_tea.jpg)

Then, we went to the Pure gym upstairs. This is a premium gym in Hong Kong (think cheaper Equinox) and off the top of my head, had these amenities:

* Main room'

    * 5 weight racks
    * Astroturf with 2 sleds

* Side room

    * A bunch of cardio machines
    * Stretching area

* Personal Trainer area--I'll skip this since I won't use this, but it's pretty big

* Outdoor area

    * Various TRX contraptions
    * Gymnastic rings
    * Boxing bag
    * Battle rope
    * That treadmill that's like a U-shape and looks like a tank track
    * View of Hong Kong skyline / Victoria Harbor

* Dumbbell area

    * Maybe 3-4 benches with dumbbells

* Machine area 1

    * Lat raise machine
    * Chest supported t-bar row
    * The large cable machines where there are 2 large wings to it (8 cable stations)
    * Various bench machines
    * Shoulder press machines

* Machine area 2 (legs)

    * Roman chair + some other ab thing
    * Squat / deadlift machine
    * Rear delt machine
    * Hack squat
    * Another machine that looks like you can do rows and can double as a squat machine
    * Hip thrust station
    * Single leg donkey kick machine
    * Some other station for ass
    * Calf raise machine
    * That one squat machine that cbum uses where you hook up a belt to an anchor and do squats. With a safety lever.

* Cardio area 2

    * Tons of ellipticals,  treadmills, and more.
    * Floor-to-ceiling views of the Hong Kong skyline / Victoria Harbor
    * On one side of this room is glass-to-ceiling view of the top-floor area of K11 Musea, and you can see other people outside looking at the same view as you. Except you're doing cardio and they're not.

* Bathroom

    * Shower stalls.
    * Shorts / shirt / socks so you don't have to bring gym clothes. You just dispose of them so staff can launder them afterwards.

    The gym's huge so I probably forgot some machines. But I think I got most of them.

    Went to Serena's parent's place for some awesome home-cooked meal (very clean, which is good because it gives my stomach a rest). Then, went home and wrote this up.

    ### Nov 30: More family & friends time

    Visited my aunt who has leukemia in the morning. Normally, she's in pain but for some reason she's in a great mood when we visited. She said me + Serena's visit makes her very happy and that her good mood helps alleviate her pain.

    Cancer tells you you're going to die soon, but we're all going to die. The main difference is cancer is constantly painful, which drains your will to exist, which is the most depressing part.

    Being able to make a cancer patient happy and provide some relief (albeit only for a few hours) feels very meaningful and I'm glad I was able to visit and take her mind off the pain a little.

    She took us around the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, which was both huge and quiet. Tons of exhibits ranging from:

    * Bruce Lee
    * Old / retro toys and magazines
    * Antiques and jewelry
    * Much more

    Given how small Hong Kong is, it was surprisingly large, spanning 2 giant floors. It was also free.

    After that, we went around a nearby park where we saw old people get together and perform some songs and dance on stage. Watching, I danced as well. Aunts were entertained.

    **All in all, we did around 10K steps over the course of a few hours.**

    Later, we went to eat at Serena's friend's place. Her friend made tons of extremely delicious food--we brought some Japanese food + red wine as offering. The latter's surprising. Was recommended by the supermarket sales and I wasn't expecting anything, but its aftertaste is a little sweet and provided a bit of relief against the numbing spicy food, and so was a really nice pairing. Here's some pics of the food.

    ![Abalone, razor clams, and more](../images/stella_kitchen.jpg)

    Serena's friend also had *Earl Grey Rum*, which was pretty dope.

    ### Dec 1: Bad Bench Press and AYCE Dim Sum

    Went to the gym and recorded my bench. My right arm is lower than the left. As is my elbow. My suspicion isn't that I'm activating one side more than the other. I think my shoulder blades are asymmetric and thus sets me up in a bad benching base. Need to confirm hypothesis by filming my shoulder blades.

    Went to my favorite place, *Ming Bistro* in Hysen Place. This is a place where they serve high-quality dim sum, in large quantities.

    Quality + quantity = yummy. Here's a sample picture of the food:

    ![Ming Bistro](../images/ming_dyn_food.jpg)

    The fried milk rolls, dumpling, savory pancakes, and spicy chicken feet are most memorable. Everything else is still really good. They also gave a *giant* coconut / red bean drink at the end to stuff me full.

    ![huge drink to finish off gluttony](../images/bigass_coco_redbean.jpg)

    And here's the menu of what we ordered.

    ![wow](../images/ming_bistro_order.jpg)

    This is about **42 items.**

    **Total = $343 HKD for 2. ($43 USD)**

    I want to sincerely apologize to *Ming Bistro* for literally eating your margins away.

    But I will probably do it again.

    For dinner, went to another one of Serena's friend's place to visit a fairly newly minted baby. Had takeout pizza (with various breads with dipping sauce) and cake. Good laughs & good get-together.

    ### Dec 2: Stroke of luck

    Did a small session of legs in gym. Due to time limitations, I maximized it by doing slow leg presses instead of squats.

    I just loaded up 4 plates each side.

    * On the positive, you don't lock out to keep tension.
    * On the negative, you go very slow. Maybe 3-4 seconds.
    * 20 reps for a set.

    As you can see, no need to go heavy. The slow reps makes your legs explode.

    Did similar sets for calves on the leg press (no calves machine), then just a set of slow hamstring curls (same method). Latter only for 1 set because I ran out of time.

    Met with Serena's parents to eat fancy chinese food. Very good:

    ![more fancy chinese food](../images/more_fancy_chinese.jpg)

    *Top left to right bottom:*

    * Chinese, savory soup. Tastes like a high-level chicken soup. But has cantaloupe that disintegrates to give it a *little* bit of sweetness. Very balanced & delicious.
    * Char siu with rice and egg.
    * Cheesy egg dish with hot pot rice.
    * Fried, moist fish with rice, along with a corn/egg, thick soup. You're supposed to ladle the soup over the rice, as a sauce. Was very delicious.

    Then, we went to a place called the Bakehouse. It's a bakery chain and very popular. Every single time, you have to wait a long time in line to sit down.

    Except this time. There was no one in line.

    Even Serena's parents said of all the times they have went to Bakehouse, it's either a shorter line or a longer one. Never *no* line.

    **Very lucky.**

    ![bakehouse](../images/bakehouse.jpg)

    Yes, those are portuguese egg tarts. Unlike Lord Stow's, they don't specialize in a flaky crust. It's more of like a mini-baked bread with burnt portuguese egg custard inside. Still delicious, just different styles.

    Later, for dinner, we ate with one of Serena's aunt, whom I have not had dinner with 1-1 like this before. Brought us to more of a local place which to be honest is my style. After having eaten at so many fancy restaurants, my vibe's more the down-and-dirty, hole-in-the-wall, local food. Though I still enjoy fancy restaurants.

    This is a restaurant that specializes in fish and fish parts. We had *lots* of food. And it was a pretty good deal (about 1100HKD, or $140 for 4 people). Here's a sample:

    ![Fish dish, spicy](../images/goodfish_1.jpg)

    ![Fish dish, sour](../images/goodfish_2.jpg)

    Above is like a fish hot pot, and they add broth if needed. Underneath the fish tray is a butane gas burner. Fish was very creamy and smooth. Veggies were super-fresh and crunchy.

    Below's some grilled eel. It was so juicy and fatty, it had almost a ribeye texture. They grilled it really well to the point that the natural oils came out to the surface and was *absolutely out of this world.* Salivating just thinking about this again:

    ![Grilled Eel](../images/grilled_eel_yum.jpg)

    

    We also ordered lots of sides, not pictured.

    ### Dec 3: Left alone

    Serena had to go to a bridal shower today, so I'm left all alone.

    Went downstairs and got:

    * Coconut cream bread
    * Egg white fluffy bread
    * 2 thick slices of swiss roll

    **All for 41HKD, about $5.25**.

    **Gym:** Only had 35 minutes. Already went quite intense the last few days, so opted for just 3 sets of heavy curls. Hit new PR at 12 reps. But to be fair I only hit 11 reps at 40lbs prior since it's not my first exercise. And at this gym, I hit 12 reps @ 18kg (~39 lbs).

    After curls, I just did 20 mins of high-incline treadmill at a moderate pace. Sweated.

    Had lunch with Serena's parents at Kikkusan. We had:

    * Grilled uni
    * Salmon salad
    * Fried chicken + cold udon
    * Hot steamed chicken with truffle rice

    ![Kikkusan](../images/kikkusan.jpg)

    Per usual, it was really good.

    After that, Serena's parents took me shopping for groceries. This is because I invited my uncle to come to dinner for hot pot. I was able to buy 8 large, hand-made cuttlefish balls for only 20HKD. I also got a huge plastic bag of organic vegetables + green onion (they gave this for *free*) + garlic...for 18HKD. Basically a **few pounds of veggies for $2 USD.** Got also:

    * Wagyu beef from Donki
    * Regular beef from Donki
    * Fatty pork from Donki
    * Dumplings from a dumpling shop
    * Mixed veggies from Donki, to be used as soup base
    * Large radish from Donki which is used to soak up all flavor in broth so you can eat it after
    * High-quality, Japanese eggs you can eat raw (raw eggs are used as part of hot pot dipping sauce)

    ![Hot pot](../images/hotpot_taikoo.jpg)

    I bought too much for 2 people.

    Luckily, Serena came back at around 8PM and helped out with finishing some of the food.

    ### Dec 4: 2 gym sessions in 1 day?!

    I woke up early to do work.

    During yesterday's bridal shower, Serena did a cooking class. She made the following:

    ![Yummy chinese pastries](../images/homemade_pastries.jpg)

    I had an egg tart for breakfast, with coffee.

    I went to Pure closeby and was very time-constrained. So I just did:

    * 3 heavy sets OHP
    * 3 sets of 10 of OHP at 70% 1RM
    * 3 sets of machine shoulder lat raises
    * 15 mins of cardio

    Was supposed to have lunch with Serena's parents, but they didn't feel well so she brought me to West Villa in Taikoo. Had the tastiest "One brother char siu" (means best char siu):

    ![1 brother pork](../images/bro_pork.jpg)

    After that, we went to K11 Musea and walked around a bit. When we were done digesting pork, we went to the Pure at K11 Musea again. We were time-constrained, once again, so I just tried to finish off some missing sets:

    * 2 sets of machine shoulder lat raises
    * 2 sets of 10 of OHP at 70%.
    * 3 sets of single-leg hamstring curl machine.
    * Horsed around a bit on other machines to show Serena how they work.
    * 20 mins cardio.

    Then, we rushed off to visit my aunt (see Nov 30) again, but this time in her home. Her maid cooked us tons of food:

    ![Tons of awesome home-cooked food](../images/insane_dinner.jpg)

    They sang karaoke and we had huge laughs. As my other uncles/aunts were there, they reminisced about the old days. And since old people do not give a fuck about anything, they let loose and just said what's on their minds. As my aunt (with leukemia) sang karaoke, my aunt's husband cried.

    Chatted until around 9:30PM and went home to sleep.

    ### Dec 5: Serena's masseuse. Hotboxing.

    Serena and I walked around a bit and then settled for lunch at Pizza Hut.

    Pizza Hut is great and kind of has a Chuck-E-Cheese vibe. Really great meal for kids, and especially for kids' birthday parties. What I like the most in particular is that their pizza crust has melted mozzarella inside it:

    <video controls  style="height:480px;">
      <source src="../images/pizza_hut_hk.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag.
    </video>

    Next, we went around and did some shopping. We just got some basic stuff like:

    * Microfiber towels
    * Wagyu meat
    * Other hotpot stuff

    Went home for a bit, and then headed out again to Serena's masseuse.

    When I came to Hong Kong 3 years ago, I visited her a few times. She's since moved to a new place. But she presses *really hard.* Painfully hard. The massages in Vietnam is nothing compared to this. When she finds a nerve that really hurts, she will put all her weight on it for a prolonged amount of time.

    It doesn't hurt any less after prolonged "massage."

    She also has a sauna inside her home. It's about 4 feet tall and is literally just a wooden box big enough for you to sit in. Leaning on the window is just a small clock so you know how long you've been in there.

    The great thing about this is that the masseuse literally bought pounds of fresh lemongrass, and other herbs from Thailand. They're kept in her fridge, and they're used whenever her clients (us) need to use the sauna. Instead of just having a boiler boil water, the steam is actually from herb-infused water so it smells like lemongrass and herbs, and it smells *extremely potent* (in a very good way).

    <video controls  style="height:480px;">
      <source src="../images/micro_sauna.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag.
    </video>

    You basically change out of your clothes and into provided shorts.

    But it was hot. Really hot. I've been in saunas and some read 60-80C (moderately warm). Most are about 80C-90C (I'd say this is about average and not too bad to be inside for 15 mins). I've been to some that are 100C and it's scalding.

    This felt like the latter. The steam coming out of the vents after a ~3 mins feel like they are searing my buttocks. So I had to keep shuffling my butt around. Minute 5 and my shorts are completely soaked, as if I gone swimming.

    I did 2 sets of 10 minutes. With 10 minute rest in between.

    When I came out, I felt dizzy and probably overdid it.

    The reason for this is because when I looked at the temperature knob, <mark>***it was at 120C.***</mark>

    After the massage, we went on a food *tear.* We started out eating some chicken broth with noodles + fish maw:

    ![fish maw chicken soup](../images/fish_maw_chk_soup.jpg)

    Then, we went to TST and looked at Bossini (my favorite clothing store due to their low prices and high quality clothing). We then proceeded to eat:

    * McDonald's fried chicken
    * Yam egg waffles + mochi egg waffles at TST's Mammy Pancake

    Walked around the pier a bit, then took the boat back (Star Ferry) to Central. The boat ride back at night is beautiful, you can see the brilliance of the Hong Kong Island skyline as part of your commute:

    ![Star Ferry night view](../images/star_ferry.jpg)

    Back to Taikoo, we went to a basement mall to hunt for discounted sashimi (perishables are discounted near closing as shops need to 86 inventory anyway). We're cheap that way.

    Instead of 170HKD, a pack of sashimi with:

    * 6 pieces salmon
    * 4 pieces tuna
    * 4 pieces toro
    * 4 pieces amberjack loin
    * Wasabi and soy sauce packets
    * Small, juicy yuzu you can squeeze tons of juice out of
    * Decorative leaves, flower

    **Was marked down to 120HKD ($15.35)**.

    Ate that and then typed this up.

    ### Dec 6

    ## Lessons

    - If my aunt's facing leukemia, death, and an extremely physically painful existence can find a way of being happy by simply having her nephew visit, I have no excuse of not finding a way to be happy in almost any situation. **Don't worry, be happy.**
    - Serena's masseuse doesn't do marketing. Purely word of mouth. She has clients that she massages for 8 hours at a time (high-ticket). The best kind of businesses are ones where quality is so good that people don't mind paying a lot for (in both time and finance).
