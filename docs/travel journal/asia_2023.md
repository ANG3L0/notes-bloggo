  ## Japan: Osaka

  ### Dec 10: Landed, and already a fugitive

  Woke up and went to airport.

  HKG Amex lounge is mid. Kind of crowded, but they have good cocktails. I had the elderflower one and that was pretty good / sweet. OnlHad a lot of canned oolong teas that you can take away. The food was OK.

  Serena's parents are also flying around the same time and they went to the Chase Sapphire Lounge. Despite Priority Pass Lounge's reputation for being stuff and overcrowded, it was quite sparse there and the space for Sapphire was *much* larger than Amex's. This is ironic since Amex is much more expensive, yet its space is much smaller and much more crowded.

  The food in Chase Sapphire is also pretty good; Serena's parents ordered fresh, hot dim sum which was pretty good. Next time, I think I will opt for Chase Sapphire lounge.

  Way before this trip, we loaded up a card called "Suica" on our Apple Wallet so we can just tap our phones and go in their metro.

  We got through customs and Google Map'd what train to take. The next one's leaving in ~10 mins and so we rushed to it. Tapped our phone at the gate and ran to the train, and boarded. Easy.

  Except for some reason, people kept kicking us out of our seats.

  Turns out, the train we took based on Google Maps recommendation requires an extra ticket. But too late. We already boarded, and only while the train was moving did we realize there were signs that say *all the seats on this train are reserved.* There's still ~35 mins left in the train journey.

  Nervous that a conductor will check tickets and fine us, I kept refreshing Google Maps to see when we'll arrive.

  A conductor walked up the car into the next car and I thought

  > This is it. Guess I'll have some public embarassment first hour I land.

  Then, the conductor came to our car.

  But to my surprise, he didn't check anyone's tickets and just looked at his machine and walked to the next car. The 35 nerve-wracking minutes passed, we pulled up to our station and scrammed.

  *This is very lucky because as we find out during dinner, Serena's parents say that they check every single time. But for some reason, they didn't check during our journey.* As Serena's dad said during dinner:

  > Within the hour of landing, and you guys are already fugitives.

  But before I talk about dinner, we got off the train and checked into Holiday Inn. After that, we went directly to the flagship Donki in Osaka and it's the only Donki where there's a *freaking ferris wheel* built in front of the building. The ferris-wheel is race-track shaped for logistical reasons, so you're basically going up/down a very slow elevator, with turns in between:

  The ferris wheel boards facing the building. After you get on, the seat rotates and faces the outside. Saw the Osaka skyline and the colors were calm.

  Dinner's great. We went to a place that has all types of Japanese food:

  * Sushi
  * Sukiyaki
  * Sobe
  * Fried oysters
  * And more

  So we ordered everything we wanted to eat. And ran out of room on our dining table:
