# Japan

We cover multiple regions in Japan. Hope you enjoy.

For the entire trip's itinerary, go [here](../itinerary).

## Osaka

### Dec 10: Landed, and already a fugitive

Woke up and went to airport.

HKG Amex lounge is mid. Kind of crowded, but they have good cocktails. I had the elderflower one and that was pretty good / sweet. OnlHad a lot of canned oolong teas that you can take away. The food was OK.

Serena's parents are also flying around the same time and they went to the Chase Sapphire Lounge. Despite Priority Pass Lounge's reputation for being stuff and overcrowded, it was quite sparse there and the space for Sapphire was *much* larger than Amex's. This is ironic since Amex is much more expensive, yet its space is much smaller and much more crowded.

The food in Chase Sapphire is also pretty good; Serena's parents ordered fresh, hot dim sum which was pretty good. Next time, I think I will opt for Chase Sapphire lounge.

Way before this trip, we loaded up a card called "Suica" on our Apple Wallet so we can just tap our phones and go in their metro.

We got through customs and Google Map'd what train to take. The next one's leaving in ~10 mins and so we rushed to it. Tapped our phone at the gate and ran to the train, and boarded. Easy.

Except for some reason, people kept kicking us out of our seats.

Turns out, the train we took based on Google Maps recommendation requires an extra ticket. But too late. We already boarded, and only while the train was moving did we realize there were signs that say *all the seats on this train are reserved.* There's still ~35 mins left in the train journey.

Nervous that a conductor will check tickets and fine us, I kept refreshing Google Maps to see when we'll arrive.

A conductor walked up the car into the next car and I thought

> This is it. Guess I'll have some public embarassment first hour I land.

Then, the conductor came to our car.

But to my surprise, he didn't check anyone's tickets and just looked at his machine and walked to the next car. The 35 nerve-wracking minutes passed, we pulled up to our station and scrammed.

*This is very lucky because as we find out during dinner, Serena's parents say that they check every single time. But for some reason, they didn't check during our journey.* As Serena's dad said during dinner:

> Within the hour of landing, and you guys are already fugitives.

But before I talk about dinner, we got off the train and checked into Holiday Inn. After that, we went directly to the flagship Donki in Osaka and it's the only Donki where there's a *freaking ferris wheel* built in front of the building. The ferris-wheel is race-track shaped for logistical reasons, so you're basically going up/down a very slow elevator, with turns in between:

The ferris wheel boards facing the building. After you get on, the seat rotates and faces the outside. Saw the Osaka skyline and the colors were calm.

Then we went to dinner. It was great. We went to a place that has all types of Japanese food. It's actually high quantity *and quality*, and they're pretty big (the restaurant is 5 stories tall):

* Sushi
* Sashimi
* Sukiyaki
* Sobe
* Fried oysters
* And more

So we ordered everything we wanted to eat. And ran out of room on our dining table. Multiple times, even after clearing a bunch of dishes. Here's a spread:

![Restaurant with variety of Japanese food](../../images/everything_jap_food_osaka.jpg)

For 4 people, ordering from a Japanese restaurant with high quality food (think uni, otoro, etc). **Was only $200 USD.**

For dessert, we had Macau's Lord Stow Bakery. Legend has it creator of Lord Stow went to Osaka himself to train people how to make Portuguese tarts.

![Lord Stow's, but with Japanese writing and in Osaka](../../images/lordstow_osaka.jpg)

We wanted creme brulee but they were sold out. Instead, we just got their tarts. Was told by Serena's parents that it is lukewarm and won't be fresh out of the oven and hot like Macau. But we were here so might as well have some.

As I was paying, a fresh batch came out and I pointed "fresh" and she gave me the fresh ones straight out of the oven. Hella hot and delicious.

*Very lucky, again.* 

**2 times in 1 day.**

### Dec 11: Universal Studios

Woke and and went to Universal Studios.

But first, we stopped at their City Walk (their entrance area), and had some McD's. Japanese McGriddles are interesting: they're just like Egg McMuffins except the buns are pancake that is soaked in a little bit of syrup. Also bought some black coffee from a vending machine. Here's what it looks like:

![Mcdonalds USJ spread](../../images/mcd_usj0.jpg)

![Mcdonalds Japan Mcgriddle](../../images/mcgriddle_jap.jpg)

How USJ works is your fastpass gives you a schedule. Unlike US, you can't just spam using fastpass, since everyone will just do that and your fastpass wait becomes as long as a regular wait. USJ has these restrictions on your fastpass:

1. You must visit certain attractions at certain times. Here's our schedule and my review of the rides:
    1. Harry Potter & Forbidden Journey ride 10:30 to 11:00 (fun, and you get to fly around everywhere)
    2. Flight of Hippogriff 11:00 - 11:30 (exciting, but really short, maybe like 20 seconds)
    3. Mario Kart Koopa's Challenge 12:30 - 13:00 (kind mid--just a video game powered by AR so it's sort of like Disney's toy story shooter)
    4. Yoshi's Adventure 13:00 - 13:30 (one of the most fun--chill ride, but you get to slowly see a lot of the famed USJ's Super Nintendo World decor up close).
    5. Spider-Man 4K3D 14:30 - 15:00. We didn't go and opted to stay in Super Nintendo World to do a bunch of eating. The ride's old and spiderman is boring. And we did it already in Florida.
    6. Hollywood Dream - The Ride: Backrop 16:30 - 17:00. This was probably the best ride and most thrilling. Played Michael Jackson's *Bad* during the ride. Our ride went backwards so you can't anticipate the next turn. The normal adrenaline rush provided by a roller coaster is further enhanced by the feeling of the unknown. Sort of an extreme version of walking with your eyes closed for a prolonged period of time and hoping you don't bump into something.

2. Further, you can only visit these rides once. For example, we can't do Hollywood Dream multiple times between 16:30 - 17:00. Once you use your FastPass once in that time slot, you must line up again in the regular line.

Before we hit any of the rides though, we went to Minions land because our first ride doesn't start until 10:30 and we entered at around 8:30. This was my favorite poster in Minion's land:

![Einstein minion at USJ](../../images/minion_einstein.jpg)

Then, we did the Harry Potter rides and had some food there. It was OK. We've had butterbeer a few times before, so nothing to write home about. After, we had some time to kill before allowed in Super Nintendo land, so we went to take some photos with Sesame Street characters. I like this one where I am flexing with Bert after he tapped my biceps and posed that I am strong lol.

![Showing off muscles with Bert](../../images/trenbert.jpg)

Finally, we went to Super Nintendo World and it was amazing. It's as colorful and vibrant as you see on YouTube. The land is so engaging because there's so many goombas, mushrooms, and a ton of other setpieces *that actually move.* So instead of just still decor, you're put into an illusion that you're actually inside a Mario world. This video from the Yoshi's adventure ride sort of shows what I'm talking about.

After the rides, we had lunch. I didn't really care about the food quality so I just ordered what would look nice on camera. Here's a video walkthrough of all the dishes, up close and personal:

<video controls  style="height:720px;">

Lunch wasn't enough, so during the meet & greet with toad, I ate him. After that, we went around some souvenir shops and took photos of us wearing funny hats. So I wore a toad hat to commemorate his passing.

![Did I violate toad?](../../images/toad_violation.jpg)

![Wearing a toad hat](../../images/toad_hat.jpg)

We eventually said goodbyte to Super Nintendo / Mario Land and had to kill time before our last ride. So we went through all the souvenir shops and did a bunch of window shopping. They apparently have hats where you can squeeze the bottom of it, and another part of the hat would move. Here's a snoopy one in action.

An interesting thing here is that if I keep it squeezed, the ears stay up. I would have thought that squeezing it pumps some air, it'd only flap up (i.e. goes down in its own due to gravity). But nope, keeping the balls squeezed make it stay up. Maybe it pushes a column of air and inflates something inside the ears to have it stay up, and when you let go of the balls, the air retracts back down/away from the ears.

Anyway, after our last ride, we met up with Serena's parents for dinner at a department store. Had iberico pork. Very good. I especially like their mascot, which is a happy, fat pig, doing karate roflmao.

![Yummy pork bento set](../../images/fried_iberico.jpg)

![Funny pig mascot](../../images/funny_pig.jpg)

After that, we went up to the 9th floor at the jump store and I took some photos with Luffy + a JJK poster.

![Me and luffy](../../images/me_x_luffy.jpg)

![Me and Yuji](../../images/me_x_yuji.jpg)

Looked at Pokemon store as well.

Then, we went to eat some Hokkaido ice cream. Went home, typed this up, and slept.

### Dec 12: Visiting Sesame Street

Met with Serena's parents at around 10AM. Traveled a few stops to Umeda, where we walked around department stores.

At around 11:30AM, we went to a seafood place where they served:

* A giant fish head
* An assortment of sashimi
* Miso soup
* Rice
* And 6 small appetizing plates (like at a Korean restaurant)

Guess how much this was?

![Ridiculous value bento meal](../../images/seafood_keiseki.jpg)

**This was only 1000 yen per person, or $6.90 USD (nice!).**

Then, we walked around department stores a bit more. At around 2PM, we decided to go to Harbs. Manhattan has Harbs, but the one closest to us shut down so there's no more accessible Harbs for us in NY.

Harbs is a Japanese desserts place and we ordered a lot of cake/set menus. Not the cheapest, but not the most expensive. We got sets because the drinks were included, and they had a rule that you *had* to order a drink if you ate there. So you're almost forced to order a set, because it is much cheaper than ordering a cake + drink separately. A set is some pasta + drink + a half slice of cake. Here's a sample of a whole slice of strawberry tart (note how big it is):

![Harbs big cake](../../images/harbs1.jpg)

They also get little details right. Their earl grey tea with lemon has the lemon peel, peeled to prevent the tea from getting too bitter.

![Lemon tea harbs](../../images/lemon_tea_harbs.jpg)

Walked around even more in department stores.

Got some small One Piece plushies at the Mugiwara store nearby. One for me, one for my brother since he also likes One Piece.

Later on, ended up at a popular grilled beef place called Yakiniku En. There's the OG place and the new one in the hotel. Not many know about the latter and the former's full always. But we checked the OG place anyway just to be sure; turns out they have walkie talkies and they just sent us to the new place and they welcomed us.

It was delicious. We only had small bites since we booked a crab place for 7:30PM. We had:

* Wagyu beef
* Beef tongue with green onion inside
* Chicken thighs
* Raw beef heart
* Egg yolk with raw beef sushi

The fire's so hot that any drop of fat from the meat down to the fire causes a big flame to rise.

![Wagyu & beef tongue](../../images/yaki2.jpg)

After our first dinner, we walked around for a bit. We went to a store where there's those machines where they dispense a large plastic ball, and you get a mystery gift inside. Serenas went for the Koala March machine and got a mini, pink Koala March box, and inside it is a pink Koala ring.

When we're done with that, we went to this Japanese store called Gelato Pique. They have a crossover with Sesame Street. They sell PJs and they are soft and stretchy. Made of mostly polyester and 1% spandex. But they are cute:

![Cookie monster PJ set](../../images/sesame1.jpg)

![Button up sesame](../../images/sesame2.jpg)

The first one isn't that practical since you can't really go outside with it. The blue makes it hard to pair the hoodie, and the hoodie droops so low that you can't see anything. Looks like a Halloween costume. You can't ever bring the pants outside since it seems like the material that would just absorb dirt and grime. It's also a bit too long so would drag on the ground. And in NY, you can be sure that one trip in the subway with this and you can set these pants on fire.

So the only use case for the PJ pair is at home. And to get the pair gets twice as much as the button up.

The button-up is way more functional. The more navy blue makes it easier to match. And the buttons are Sesame Street characters, which is dope as hell. So I bought that one. About 11800 yen ($81 USD). Can be worn at home during winters and chill, or worn outside on a winter day.

After a good day of shopping, went to eat crabs. Had all kinds of varieties of crab:

* Crabs in cheese sauce
* Crab in steamed egg with a tomato sauce
* Sashimi crab legs
* Cooked crab legs
* Crab siu mai
* Various crab sushi, including crab innards sushi
* Bunch of veggies, like enoki mushrooms
* Konjak noodles

Spread example:

![Crab place spread](../../images/crab_spread.jpg)

And, at the end, once we were mostly done with everything, they will add egg and rice to the crab soup hot pot to make porridge. This is reminescent of Korean hot pot places where they'll take the rest of the spicy sauce and use it to do fried rice for you.

Once we were done with that, they served vanilla ice cream with matcha. Matcha's done with matcha powder + boiling water--they mix it and then pour it on top of the vanilla ice cream. By liquid matcha's cold by the time you eat it as it cools down touching the ice cream.

You eat it by scooping the vanilla ice cream and scoop some liquid matcha up with it--very nice juxtapose between the sweetness of the vanilla and the slight bitterness of matcha.

Once we were done with that, we walked home as Serena was tired. Serena's parents were more energetic, so instead went on to walk around Osaka some more.

Oh, to be young again.

On our way home, we stopped by Lawson (small convenience store, like 7/11), and got 2 **dorayakis.** They're like pancake with stuff red-beans, except our dorayaki also has cream in it so it was extra yum.

### Dec 13:
