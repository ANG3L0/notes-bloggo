# Vienna, Insbruck, Dolomites, Kufstein, Munich 2024

## Overview

This is a 12 day trip traveling to different places. August 7-19.

For Serena's friend's wedding. And then romantic excursion with Serena.

## Prologue: Taylor's Tears

EWR->VIE.

EWR is a shitshow, as usual. TSA Pre was about 20 minutes.

Luftansia business lounge re-opened recently though, so we actually have a lounge for the first time in EWR.

Got on airplane and I went to the bathroom. When I went back, Serena told me passenger in front of her having a nervous breakdown due to:

1. She thought she booked a window seat for +$70, but ended up in the middle seat (but couldn't find a receipt for it)
2. Taylor Swift concert in Vienna is cancelled due to terrorist attacks.

Turns out, the whole plane was mostly women going to Taylor's concert.

The Nervous Breakdown women started handing out frienship bracelets she handmade which were Swiftisms like:

*Midnights*

*Shake It Off*

And so on.

Wanted to quip and asked if she had one for *Cancelled*. But it's probably too soon, as most of the plane bought inflated plane ticket prices (due to the demand for seeing Taylor) and will be staying at inflated price hotels, in Vienna, with almost nothing to do.

Various passengers complained.

Flight attendant complained how she got a new dress at target just to see the concert.

Long story short, they all coped and did some kumbaya shit together and took a bunch of selfies and videos together.

But obviously, the real solution is just to not get swept up in a celebrity's marketing scheme so you feel like you have to pay exhorbitant amounts and travel across the globe just to watch them sing a few songs that tug at your heartstrings. This is because you can't control terrorist attacks / cancellations, but you can control your downside risk should such things happen.

I like Taylor as much as that next person, but I'd watch her if she was nearby. Not if she's halfway across the world.

## Chapter 1: The Austrian Wedding

### Day 1: 2-Starred Michelin Restaurant

Landed around 7AM.

Got into city at 8AM.

Dropped off bags at hotel lobby, and they let us use the spa to freshen up / shower.

Ate breakfast / bought coffee.

Coffee here is 9 euros which is obnoxious. So we went to luxury shops to **bait free water and coffee**. You basically pretend to be an interested buyer, where then the sales would ask you if you want something to drink (coffee, water, and/or champagne are the usual choices). Exploit their attempt at forcing reciprocity by leaving after you finish your drinks.

Walked around til 12PM where Serena's friends booked a 2-start michelin restaurant.

It had all the michelin restaurant things. They cooked a piece of char with melted honeywax, and then excavated it once the wax solidified. And it was perfectly cooked. They also had caviar and was pretty extra.

Some dishes taste good, and some dishes were mediocre, but the one I liked best was this:

  <figcaption>Melted honey wax to cook the fish. Solidified later and they excavated the fish, perfectly cooked. Didn't taste like honey though.</figcaption>

A textured grilled/fried potato. Each slice tasted like McDonald's french fries.

1127 euro total, which is just enough for my new Capital One card to meet its requirements to get 40K signup bonus points.

After, we went home and napped until 5:30PM or so. Then went to the welcome dinner.

### Day 2 - Watching Everyone Else Shop But Me

Woke up. Ate breakfast downstairs. Went to hotel gym.

Hotel gym is tiny. Just a dumbbell rack that goes up to a whole 10kg. And a single machine that has:

* Flyes
* Lat pulls
* Leg extensions
* A pullup bar at the bottom for rows or bicep curls
* Handles for bicep cable preacher curls

It seems like every position you take in the machine, you could accidentally do another exercise.

Anyway, as I hogged the machine for a few sets this guy kept watching me closely for ~5 sets before working up the courage to ask to work in. The way he watched me was weird because you generally just glance to see if someone's taken up a machine but Serena said this guy was watching me do every exercise.

After gym, went back to room to shower and went out to some art museum. Art of note were [Napoleon Crossing The Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Crossing_the_Alps) and [The Kiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(Klimt)), the latter of which Serena and I posed a parody in front of the painting.

Went to eat lunch at Caf√© Landtmann. It was between OK and subpar. 3/5.

High fashion shopping was next (with the intent to goad salespeople into giving us free water/alcohol). First few shops didn't really offer anything, but Burberry gave us lemonades and alcoholic drinks. We then went to Moncler, where they didn't offer us anything despite a couple of Serena's friends committing to buying a few of their expensive jackets already.

Having none of this, I explicitly asked for water.

Seeing as how Serena and her friends were trying on new jackets for ~1h, I asked the staff to help me find some cool jackets I could rock as well. They gave me some, but they were all veto'd by either Serena or her friends due to at least one of the following:

* Size
* Cutting
* Style
* Color

So the girls all bought jackets (6) except me. Total time spent there was about 2 hours.

Afterwards, we ate at a place called Plachutta. It was good. Here's a video of the platter of food:

</figure>

Dishes of highlight were:

* Liver mouse
* Calf liver
* Beef tongue
* Bone marrow

At the end, they kept pushing me for a 10% tip, to which I said no because there's already a 4.8 euro service charge per person. And in Europe, it is not customary to leave a percentage based tip. So nah.

5/5. Except 4/5 because the weird tipping thing.

### Day 3: The Wedding!

Did breakfast, skipped gym, and went to go shopping.

Witnessed Serena's friends buy some Hermes rings and bracelets.

Went back home, changed, and hopped on a bus to the wedding.

Arrived at 3PM after a 90+ minute bus ride, and the ceremony starts at...3PM. Many people had full bladders, so the ceremony was delayed until 3:10PM so people with bladder control issues (i.e. me) can empty them.

Apertifs from roughly 4P-6P. There was salami with truffles which was really good. I drank quite a bit...of coffee. I also drank some free alcohol as well, but drinkwise it was probably:

1. 1.5 schnapps
2. 3 glasses wine
3. 3 espressos (and 3 more in the morning, totaling 6)

As I type this at 1AM after a long day, I am wide awake (I normally sleep at 9PM for comparison).

Dinner from around 6P-8P. It was good. Highlights:

* Steak
* Risotto
* Blueberry Macaroon -- nice and tart

8P-9P was just chill and wedding cake cutting / socializing. The wedding cakes were actually 3 cakes/pies and were really good. I liked all 3 varieties they offered, in this order:

1. Lemon meringue pie
2. Coffee cake
3. Chocolate mousse

The tartness in the lemon meringue pie really comes through. None of that pussy ass American shit where they say it is a lemon meringue pie but it's just diabetes with a small hint of lemon. The sourness punches through and tastes strong and balances very nicely with the cream on the top of the pie.

9PM was fireworks and first dance, and they danced twice as we demanded an encore. I loved the fireworks as it was super up-close. I haven't had fireworks this up close since I celebrated July 4th at a friend's place where his neighbors were illegally setting off fireworks (which also subsequently set off a bunch of car alarams). But to be fair, this is probably even closer -- the cannons were about 10 meters away.

We all headed to the dance floor and danced at around 10PM. I'm a great improvisational dancer as I like feeling and moving to the beats, and I am generally uninhibited (even when sober).

Headed home from the wedding venue, which is a castle, at around 11PM and then arrived back at hotel at around 12:00AM.

### Day 4: Now I Know Why Arnold Left Austria

Sunday, everything's closed. Not much stands out today.

I do remember that there's a church blasting Taylor Swift for stranded Swifties. But I thought churches were built to worship God and/or Jesus, not false idols (and definitely not celeb idols).

And I guess that's Austria in general for me. The wedding-specific event stands out to me, but everything else is just OK. There's sausages, cheese, and ham for food. There's a limited selection for shopping. Some museums.

Everything Austria has to offer, most other cities offer better versions.

Most things here are just OK (5 to 6 out of 10), but nothing really stands out in Austria, specifically. Nothing's terrible here, except for the lack of air conditioning in most places. People here smoke a lot and there's a lot of body odor here. Food's only charcuterie.

Well, on to the next city.

## Chapter 2: Nature Calls

### Day 5: Eating (Mostly) Normal Food In Innsbruck

Yesterday, I reservation an Uber XL to show up at 5:20AM to pick us up to go to the train station for 45 euros.

Today, I was taking a dump at around 4:45AM and still no driver took the order. Nearby, there's a bunch of cars and it was only 20 euros if I cancelled the reservation and booked an XL directly.

At 4:48AM I was done with my dump and wanted to cancel, but alas, someone took the order and it'd be 48 euros to cancel.

**The lesson here is don't procrastinate. If there's a good deal, execute immediately.**

Not only that, instead of an XL showing up, just a regular ass 4-person Prius showed up. 2-starred.

We took a train ride to Innsbruck as a way to stage for the next phase of our trip, as a private guide will pick us up from Innsbruck and then show us around Dolomites. Thus, this was mostly a rest day.

For 5 hours of business class train, it only cost 220 euros (110 pp) -- this is insane considering we got a 4-seater cabin to ourselves. An old couple came to take the other 2 seats they reserved, but they wanted more space, so they left after a minute (presumably to find untaken seats in business class). The 5 hours went by fast.

I learned some React.js for a couple hours and fell asleep.

After, we arrived at Innsbruck at 11AM and was able to check in early. Then, we went out to eat at an Italian place. It was really, really good.

For the first meal, we had a salad with burrata. The burrata was super fresh and moist. The pasta was some ragu, and the cherry tomatos really popped. Really hit the spot for my depraved taste buds. **4.5/5 meal.**

Right after, we went to another Italian place. We had a pizza which was mushroom + parma ham. It was really good. The crust was airy/fluffy, like a freshly baked foccacia. The tagliatelle pasta dish had a very rich tomato + olive oil sauce, with some veggies and guancale, which was amazing as well. The mushroom in the pasta was juicy and buttery. The pasta was piping hot *and* al dente which is not a combination I've had in years. Basically, the perfect pasta dish. **5/5 meal.**

![Italian Food 2](../images/innsbruck_meal2.jpg)

You might be wondering, I'm still in Austria, why's there so much Italian food?

Innsbruck is a small strip of land sandwiched between Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. So its cuisine has plenty of influence from all 3 countries.

It's also why it is a great location / staging area, if you want to go travel between these countries.

Before dinner, we went to the hotel spa. First time me and Serena did sauna together. We did a very hot one at around 80C and a much cooler one at ~37C. Went back to our room, showered, and headed out.

For dinner, we had Thai food which was OK (3/5, not worth attaching pics here)--we had a papaya salad which wasn't spicy at all, a coconut crispy duck curry which was good (but could be crispier), and nasi goreng which they confused for curry fried rice. The fried rice was too moist, and to serve nasi goreng as curry fried rice is insane. Nasi goreng and curry fried rice has rice in common, but that's about it. It would be like if I put deep dish pizza on a menu and served you cheeze-its.

Despite this, the restaurant was jam-packed with white people. And it's a large restaurant where the dishes weren't cheap at all.

This brings us to the second lesson: **As long as the market's good, you can get away with selling a mediocre product.** Thus, the most profitable thing that the restaurant did was to invest the time to pick a place to serve Thai food where 1) the people won't know it's mid Thai food, and 2) there's not a lot of competition--this is much better time spent than making their dishes excellent in a more competitive / educated market.

## Lessons

* Execute on good deals / arbitrages immediately. Procrastinating even a few seconds = opportunity gone. The market won't let good opportunities appear for long.
* As long as the market's good, you can just have a mediocre product. Focus almost all efforts on the market, and just ship a shitty product you improve upon later.
