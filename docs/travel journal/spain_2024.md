# Spain 2024

## Overview

Serena had a business trip in Malaga, so I met her in San Sebastian to eat. 

San Sebastian is the food capital of the world, boasting the highest number of michelin stars per capita.

I like food, and we've been wanting to go for a long time.

The main hurdle is that it's kind of out of the way. But seeing as how Serena has a Spain business trip, we might as well capitalize on that and visit San Sebastian.

It also coincides with my birthday, so this is a nice birthday trip as well.

Itinerary is Oct 10 through Oct 16.

## JFK to San Sebastian

*Iberia sucks.*

That was my thought after watching a lot of YouTube videos.

And I was anxious because the itinerary is JFK -> MAD -> BIL. With a 1-hour connection. Within the 1 hour, I needed to:

1. Get out of the plane
2. Go through customs
3. Go to another terminal
4. Go through security in the other terminal
5. Check out the lounge
6. Find my gate

Given Iberia's reputation, there are a lot of things that can go wrong here.

Fortunately, everything went very smoothly. The food wasn't terrible. I was able to make my transfer while knocking out all 6 things in an hour.

Things that sucked:

* No lounge if you're not business class (no credit card perks in T8 JFK)
* Everyone coughing everywhere, kind of disgusting as I can feel droplets landing on my arm
* When you recline, your knees jam up against the seat in front of you
* My recline is broken. Every few hours, it would slowly un-recline and I have to recline again.

Landed in BIL around 8:15AM local time, caught 8:45AM bus to San Sebastian, and arrived to hotel at around 10:15 AM.

## San Sebastian

### Dia Uno: I kicked an old man out of a queue

Surprisingly, there was a hotel room available and the nice man at the counter gave us wonderful service / recommendations. After a quick shower, we headed out and our first stop **IS TO EAT BASQUE CHEESECAKE.**

We went to the restaurant **WHERE BASQUE CHEESECAKE WAS INVENTED** (La Viña) and consumed:

* **Basque cheesecake**. It is really creamy and smooth. The cheese is a silky texture. Not too heavy, yet decadent. The burnt bits weren't bitter but gave it a smoky flavor. This is in contrast with imitations where the cheesecake might be too dense, or the crust is too burnt, overpowering the cheesecake.
* **Cafe latte.** I'm jetlagged.
* **Tortilla.** Back in 2021 when I went to Barcelona, the tortillas were OK. Was tough, dense, and just like a not-sweet tomago. Here, it's heaven. My enthusiasm was curbed. The potatos inside had a very satisfying texture, and the egg was mildly runny. The whole effect is a very creamy, yet savory tortilla that had a really nice egg yolk flavor to it.

**All for only $13.15 USD.**

Here's a photo of my enjoying the cheesecake.

**5/5. Easy. Great first meal in Basque.**

We finished at 11:28AM.

Then we went next door to La Cepa (all these Pintxos restaurants were next to each other in their old town, which is a relatively small town center). We had:

* **Ham + mayo + tomato pintxos**. The parma ham and the mayo's flavor mixed really well.
* **Chorizo + pimiento (pepper) skewer**. It was freshly fried and the spicy oil they used on it was excellent.
* **A large bowl of fried pimientos**. Really, really good. Hard for fried peppers in olive oil not to be good.

**All for only $14.24 USD.**

  <figcaption>He said this was a 'small portion' of fried peppers. OK.</figcaption>
</figure>

**For the value, again, 5/5.**

We finished at 11:44AM.

Then we went to a place called *Bar Sport.* The story behind this is last time we went to Spain, and we ordered a large thing of fois gras which I rarely ever get the chance to eat, *Serena ate 90% of the portion.* I have been giving her shit since then so a fois gros revenge was in order. We got:

* **3 portions** of fois la plancha (grilled fois gros) pinxtos
* Red wine

Fois gros is normally expensive, but in total **this was only $21.80 USD.**

![Fois gros revenge](../images/spain24/me_fois.jpg)

The fois gras is *really* savory and *extremely heavy.* Normally, I can eat very fatty foods and I don't really feel full. But on my last bite of fois, I experienced for the first time in my life going from "mmm, this is good, I'm quite hungry and can eat a lot more" to my stomach telling my brain "you are extremely full, please stop eating" between bites.

In retrospect though, it was extremely delicious. Cooked perfectly. Remarkably generous portions to turn my hunger into a food coma in literally, not figuratively, a few bites. **5/5.**

We finished at 12:23PM.

Then we went to Casa Urola. We had:

* **Cappuccino**. I am still jetlagged.
* **Mushroom mini-pie / quiche.** It was really savory and complex. You'd mistake it for an amuse bouche at a fine-dining restaurant.
* **Scallop with some garlic/white sauce reduction, topped with seaweed.** Again, by itself, you'd mistake it for a fine-dining course.
* A large thing of water.

![Scallop](../images/spain24/scallop.jpg)

I was *really* full from the fois. But the scallop was really delicious. Normally, when I'm extremely full, food no longer tastes that good. This is one of the few, if not the only time in my life where I'm in slight pain due to fullness but really want to keep eating because the dish is so damn good.

Also, the plating at Casa Urola is superb. But I'd say if you just judge by the taste and uniquness, eating pintxos around San Sebastian old town is like cherry-picking the most interesting fine-dining bites you're interested in, and paying only a few Euros per pinxtos.

In Casa Urola's case, it was **$18.08 USD**. **5/5.**

We finished at 12:48PM.

In other words, within about 90 minutes, we ate everything above across 4 restaurants.

As I'm still jetlagged, we went to the hotel room to rest. We finally worked up the courage to go eat outside at around 6PM.

We went to a place close to our hotel, la bodega donostiarra gros. We had:

* Beef tripe. Texture is really great. The sauce is not too savory but it was just right considering how savory everything else we had in the day was.
* Tuna in olive oil. Kind of dry.
* "Blood pudding" -- this actually was really good. Instead of tasting like regular blood pudding which is very salty and fatty a lot of times, this tasted more exactly like soondae. It was more chewy and lighter, while still being peppery and meaty enough to taste really delicious.
* Tuna with anchovies. Tuna still kind of dry.
* More water.

All this was for **$20.87 USD.** I'm not too impressed by the tuna as the canned tuna I eat at home is less dry, but since everything else is pretty good, **3.5/5**.

Right after, we made our way to Ganbara, whose claim to fame probably came from Anthony Bourdain talking about it at some point. We got *very* lucky to be able to get in here.

The internet recommends waiting in line 30 minutes *before* opening. We only went 15 minutes before because we had the pre-dinner, and we didn't know any better. When we got in the semi-long queue, the owner came out and split the line in 2.

The reasoning's because if the line's too long, the other shops are blocked by the line, so while the first 1/3rd of the line can stand in front of the restaurant, the rest formed a line across the road. Fair enough.

But this one old guy came and started lining up in the front 1/3rd of the line, effectively cutting in front of everyone else waiting in line. There were some discussions to tell the guy but eventually I went in. The reason's because these restaurants are small, so even 1 customer can be the difference of whether I get to eat here or not.

> Sir, the end of the line's over there.

And off he went, to the correct end of the line.

The owner came out and started counting who could go in the restaurant and who couldn't. **SERENA AND I WERE LITERALLY THE LAST ONES.**

This reminds me of the famous [poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...) about speaking up.

> First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
>      Because I was not a socialist.
>
> Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
>      Because I was not a trade unionist.
>
> Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
>      Because I was not a Jew.
>
> Then they came for my queue—and I told him to get to the back of the line.

We ate:

1. Razor clams. These tasted *really* fresh and juicy. They also topped it with olive oil which further enhanced the flavors.
2. Their famed mushroom dish, which has a raw egg yolk and a bunch of expensive mushrooms on the plate with olive oil. It was amazing. I've never had so much intense mushroom flavors in my mouth in a single meal.
3. Spider crab pastry. The pastry is really creamy and very soft, almost like whipped cream. The textural juxtapose with the flaky crust, like you would in a flaky-crust egg tart, is really well done.
4. A few txokoli (light white wine).
5. Monkfish skewer, with alternating shrimp and sauces. The shrimp was nice and bouncy, with a light flavor, which is a really nice flavor juxtapose with the monkfish which is more soft/creamy with a heavier flavor.
6. Fried milk pastry with ice cream. The milk inside the fried pastry is nice and fluffy and warm, like a loving hug. This contrasts well with the vanilla ice cream. The fried milk is actually a bit sweet, and the vanilla ice cream is more neutral-sweet. Thus, the ice cream acts as a nice way to temper both the sweetness and the temperature.
7. Giant shrimp. The head juice is really creamy and delicious. And luckily from our previous experience at Lisbon's Ramiro's, we know how to dissect a giant shrimp without its delicious juice leaking all over the place. No real talent needed to make this one, but the ingredient is so amazing it just stands on its own. It's also 40 euro for 1 shrimp.

In total, this was **$137.51 USD.** Easy 5/5. Spectacular, unique flavors.

After shoving 6 meals down my stomach, I realized I was on a bulk. So we walked around and saw a pasteleria and had a *suspiros* (meringue) which had a powdered / sugary crust, but a savory, creamy egg yolk paste, similar to ovos moles. Only **$2.19 USD**.

![Suspiros](../images/spain24/suspiros.jpg)

After dessert 1 was done, we stumbled upon a gelataria and ate a small cup of gelato: 1 scoop nocciola (they called it Ferrero Rocher) and 1 scoop pistaccio. Only **$3.29 USD**, which is cheaper/more generous than my favorite gelato place in the whole world, Giolitti.
