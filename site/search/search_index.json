This means you get a private driver that takes you around different places and you don't really have to plan anything. No crowding in busses adhering to some group schedule. Stop whenever you want, wherever you want. Just tell to driver to go and they'll drive you there.</p> <p>It's our first time doing this kind of a VIP trip because if you did this anywhere else, it'd be prohibitively expensive. But with $3K, it included:</p> <ul> <li>VIP service</li> <li>Breakfast at all hotels</li> <li>Lodging</li> <li>3 or 4 dinners</li> </ul> <p>I highly recommend them.

I didn't sleep. It was one of those rundown airports where you get off the plane onto the tarmac, and then you take a bus to your terminal.</p> <p>My customs was slightly delayed because I didn't know that we had to know where we were staying. I just told the customs officer I don't know where I was staying as the tour guide booked it.</p> <p>Terminals are switched. Maps say you will land in Terminal 1 but you'll land in Terminal 2. When we departed at the end of our journey, Google said we will depart at T1 but instead needed to walk to T2. No biggie though as they're in the same complex. Minor inconvenience is having to coordinate with the driver and have them switch terminals.</p> <p>It was hot and our luggage took an hour after customs to arrive. Run-down, slow service was to be expected, so I wasn't mad.</p> <p>Greeted by our driver, he was dressed in a suit so the vibe completely changed from there on from run-down, poor-service to VIP, excellent service.</p> <p>We went to a Mosque and it was cool.</p> <p>After, we headed directly for Rabat since we were told that other than the Mosque, there's not much to do in Casablanca.</p>"},{"location":"travel%20journal/morocco/#lessons","title":"Lessons","text":"<ol> <li>Mental framing is important.

Businesses are inefficient in the world; airports are no different. If you don't know how much time something will take, you should allot for more time.
